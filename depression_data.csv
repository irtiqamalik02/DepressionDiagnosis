matgv6,Earlier today I was watching Hook and absolutely lost my shit when Peter was starting to act like a kid again. I broke down wishing I could go back to being able to be a kid again or even like one again. I miss the feeling of being free be imaginative and not be judge. I like I still have my imagination but I hate that as an adult people have lost theirs. I want to go back or to a place like Neverland.,2021-03-22 23:16:15
matc0r,"I can't look in a mirror.
I can't have my photograph taken.
I hate people touching me.
I think guys who flirt with me are playing a prank.
I think I am worthless.
I don't think I deserve love.
I'm 29, suicidal, and depressed.

Maybe it sounds melodramatic, but all of this started with bullies in my secondary school. I'd randomly get called ""fat"" in the corridors, and one girl in particular would destroy me every time I had to have a lesson with her. Some memorable quotes are ""I'd be sick if you got a boyfriend"" and ""you're so ugly I want to cry"". It got worse as I got older, and one of the girls would get her boyfriend and his friends to drive past me and hurl abuse from their car windows. Really imaginative stuff like ""fat cow"".

I know that as an adult I would have been able to brush all of this off a lot easier. I can see now that I was never fat (just a medium build!) and I wasn't ugly. So sometimes I lie awake at night and wonder why those people attacked me so often, what spurred them on to completely destroy my self-esteem and mental health. What makes a person want to do that? It baffles me.

They've left me with episodes of crippling depression that always start with the nagging doubts of those bullies at the back of my mind. It doesn't matter to me that I'm studying for my PhD, that I've got a good job, or living the nice cosmopolitan life in London that I always dreamed of as a teenager. The only thing that apparently matters is that I am not worthy of happiness or love because some bitches told me as much over a decade ago. 

It sounds crazy, but bullies really can destroy a child's adulthood. So I implore each and everyone of you to think of the repercussions of your actions and words, and to please just be a decent human being. Words really fucking hurt. Of course, there are many other contributing factors to my anxiety and depression these days, but I genuinely think I would be healthier had I not endured years of bullying.

I just want the pain to end.",2021-03-22 23:10:24
mat4ou,"I'll always be stuck in the same place, doing the same things, being the same person. I'll never grow, I'll never change, I'll never move on. I am immovable. I am stagnant. I am a rock on the side of the road. The most I can ever do is be there to smile and wish people well on their journey as they come and go, leaving me alone again until the next one passes by.

I should be happy being a rock, but I'm not. I want more. I want to be on a journey, too. But I never will be. No matter how many times I reach out for help from a therapist, I either get turned away or swindled out of money and given nothing useful.

mat1s9,"I don’t know what this is. a vent maybe?

but yeah, I recently tried to tell my dad a bit about how I feel and he insisted I get therapy. I went through the whole roller coaster of emotions on that one, acknowledging I need it but really not wanting to do it. my dad contacted his old therapist in my place but she told him I had to call myself since I’m an adult.

I have trouble making phone calls, among other things (not to mention phoning to ask for therapy from a stranger is even harder), so this took me some time. like 3 weeks.

but I eventually called. she didn’t answer so I left a voice message saying I wanted to set up an appointment.

it has been almost two months. she hasn’t called me back. 

I still feel rejected and hurt and terrible. I don’t know if she thinks I’m just not worth helping because I took so long to call. but right now, as my mind is getting worse and worse, I can’t stop thinking about this experience any time I try to consider opening up or getting help again.

it took me YEARS to even tell my dad a little bit of how I felt and now I don’t think I can ever do it again.

masykb,"I wake up angry and bitter about having to do my job I hate and count the minutes until I’m done. When it’s over I sit around bored, I watch TV shows that don’t entertain me, I play video games I don’t especially enjoy, and sometimes I talk to people I whose company I dislike. Sometimes just to shake things up I go on the internet and get angry at other peoples’ opinions. Eventually I’ve wasted enough time that I can go to sleep and begin the cycle again. 

Every single thing in my life, as soon as I begin doing it I can’t wait for it to be over.

In my youth I could cling to the hope that “things would change” in time, but there’s nothing left of that hope. There’s no change left, this is simply how I am. I was born with a piece missing.

Other people say they feel this way, but their actions contradict their words. There’s life in their actions. They say they’re like me but I don’t believe them.

I have friends, but interacting with them gives me nothing but anxiety and I leave or hang up as soon as I can. Same with family, I visit my parents out of a obligation but I’m tense and filled with dread the whole time until I leave. Occasionally I even date, but it’s a desperate reach for normality - I don’t remember the last time I was sincerely attracted to or even simply could stand spending time with anyone of any gender.

Sometimes I take downers, which “help” in a sense that it’s a temporary escape from the anxiety and depression that fill all my waking hours, but I also don’t enjoy them, nor do they actually change anything in the long term — They’re like sleeping, they just push the problem a few hours off into the future. It seems to me if I’m going to sit around medically sedated all day I might as well just be dead.

I like sleeping and dreaming but the paradox is that you can’t truly enjoy dreams while they happen. It’s not until you wake up and they’re gone that you appreciate the feelings you had, even if they were caused by imaginary stimuli.

I don’t know what to do. I’m getting to a point where I feel like I want to die simply because there’s nothing else to do. It’s not shame or anxiety, it’s just becoming the most logical option every passing day — if you’re driving to an unknown destination would you rather be there immediately or sit in traffic for several hours first? The destination itself is irrelevant, I just know I don’t like sitting in traffic.",2021-03-22 22:54:06

Now that I’m more self aware I know its was depression. I didn’t know at that time but I’ve been struggling with depression for 6 years.

I guess my downward slope in life began when i was 17 years old, after my father died of cancer. During the years after that i did quite alright, but because i never processed the death of my father very well, that would come to haunt me. I got a degree in a trade and did that trade for a bit. Even though i never liked it, i chose it because people recommended it to me and i had no clue what else to do. At 20 i moved away to live by myself because living with my mother became unbearable. It would become more clear later why this was the case. While i was living by myself i chose to get a higher education, but unfortunately flunked out. This is when depression hit me like a truck. I didn’t know what to do with my life, didn’t want to go back doing the trade i hated, depression caused me to loose any willpower to get the smallest things done, and above that my mother started to show more and more disturbing behaviour.
I just stopped partaking in life i guess. Throughout the years my mother’s behaviour became very worrying, and i slipped deeper and deeper in the black pit of depression. Eventually my mother got diagnosed with schizophrenia, and because she was handling her personal finances more and more irresponsibly, and refused to receive any kind of help or treatment, i had to battle it out in court against her in order to get a financial administrator to look after her finances. The judge agreed with me, and not long after that my mother got sued by somebody else for her behaviour, and in that case the judge decided my mother had to be taken to a mental hospital for treatment. She stayed there for 3 years, and after that she was allowed to go home again. She is doing ok now. She takes her medication and is followed up by a team of medical professionals.
Unfortunately i haven’t gone anywhere. I remain in the claws of depression, and feel like i can’t get out. I am 33 years old now and wasted so much of my life. Time moved on but i haven’t. I’ve tried therapy, but came to a point where i felt it didn’t benefit me anymore. I am sick of my situation and want to do something about it, but don’t even know where to start, or how to start. I have a lot of unhealthy habits, haven’t had a job in so long, haven’t had a girlfriend for just as long. How do i even explain that gap to an employer?

marl0e,"I should have known it was coming. After a week of exercise and eating a bit better i was feeling good, perhaps *too* good. And today came. I felt awful. Just angry and despairing at everything. When these phases come over me it's like someone else has taken the wheel and I'm just along for the ride. 

I tried to phone my doctor, book an appointment with them or a counselor, the need to just talk this despair out of me was unrelenting. But with lockdown and covid its hard for any kind of appointment to be made. They told me on the phone that someone may get back to me later. 

After that I decided. I had it planned, go into one of the empty offices in work, open up my wrists and let it happen. I'd be gone before anyone found me. I took a blade out of a pencil sharpener (of all things!). My family wouldn't have to see the aftermath, it would be some place they'd never see. My housemate wouldn't have to find my body. It all seemed right, and I convinced myself it was time. Just have one last cigarette and then  I'd be ready.

Well, ironically that cigarette probably saved my life because while sat there smoking I thought ""maybe I should call someone"". I called a hotline and basically just cried my eyes out on the phone. Something about crying and letting it all out feels like something unclenches inside and you're able to see things a bit clearer. I still believe I need long term help, counselling or therapy, something I've avoided for a long time. Tablets saved me once, but I need to address issues from a long time ago.

The best thing you can do is reach out to your family and ask to see a therapist. If they say no, there are many support groups, even online. But any kind of cognitive therapy would help you. I can guarantee it. However, if you don’t feel an instant connection with your therapist, find a new one. You have to connect with the person who is helping you, otherwise you will feel like you’re doing something wrong again. I’ve been through 9 therapists until I found one that clicked. It’s a huge help to have someone who is a third party to talk to. It gives you a different perspective and you have zero judgement. 

Maybe a guidance counselor at school could help? Idk though... the school system can be iffy, but certainly a support group would help. Even volunteering, doing something nice for someone else, instantly makes me feel good and less mad.

The pay was fine, but holy moly the experience is undescribable... I felt so degraded everyday by the constant cursing and blaming of the mistakes which was not my fault to begin with.

After I quit my job I thought I will be better but holy shit I wasn't. My anxiety started kicking in even tho I always reassure myself that I can do it. Ever since I quit my job, my mom started pressuring me that I should find a job and that mental health wasn't a big deal at this point. So I did what she said to me, ignored all my personal problems and started to look for work. While finding a job on my spare time I'd try to freelance by editing thesis and essays for some of my friends who are taking their master. They paid me but not as high as my salary before. 

Now I still don't have a job, and feeling hopeless. Actually not hopeless dreadful, the experience I got was too much for me. So... Is there a fast way to killing myself? Thanks for the answers.",2021-03-22 21:28:06
maqufy,"Dealt with depression anxiety before. Received therapy. Feel much better. Anxiety and depression well controlled and stopped seeing therapist over 3 mo ago. 

Ive had existential crisis before but usually after some time it goes away. 

Now it is just nagging me. I still look forward to things in life and dont feel depressed but this feeing of ‘i will die one day’ is getting to me. 

In the past it would just disappear and if the next day i think back to the episode my brain basically says ‘big deal we all did just focus on the now’. Now when im trying to be distracted or going about my business this nagging feeing comes back at me and it pesters me. 

The only big changes recently are that i had a stomach upset ( i think) a few days ago and also my birthday was last week.

Its a comfort to talk to people who understand. 
I feel the same way, im not on edge, worried about what i say. Depression is something one must experience to truly understand. Many who do understand share a bond that one cannot possess without having experienced it. There are many reasons, and no, its not weird.",2021-03-22 21:39:28

gru0k0m,yes but the problem is in the real world alot of people hide their depression. theres so many people you would be surprised to find out they were severely depressed. even i hide it quite well. nobody really knows just how depressed i am. even my own family. they know i have some sort of anxiety disorder that disables me but they have no idea how depressed i am. how much it fucking hurts inside to not be able to live the life i wanted. thats why this place is comforting. we can all get out our true feelings and be understood and not judged.,2021-03-22 22:59:38

maqmj6,"I hate my job. I have severe case of imposter syndrome in my role and feel underqualified. I dislike the work that I do and am not passionate about it. I'm not a fan of my company's culture - there is not much work/life balance, my manager loves to micro-manage, and my only work friends are from my old team but with WFH this past year, the social interactions have diminished. Quitting isn't really an option for now so I have to stick it through, at least for the next 6 months. But every day I wake up and I dread going to work. I feel sick to my stomach in the mornings and filled with anxiety thinking about what I might have to deal with. I am unmotivated to do any work unless the deadline is coming up on me and I must. During high stress periods at work, I find myself crying both during work and also at night thinking about how I'm going to sleep just to wake up and do it all over again. I want to leave but I just can't.

Outside of work, I should also be studying for a designation but I'm starting to realize that I again have no interest in doing this type of work. My exam has been postponed several times so I already feel burnt out from the time I did spend studying before and I just can't get myself into the headspace to pick it up again and continue despite knowing that the new exam date is creeping up again. I can't really opt out of it now since the fees are already paid and people at work are expecting me to go through with this. I feel like I am trapped in doing this.

This probably all stems because of my career path and it's not something I enjoy. But I feel like I've already dedicated so much time in trying to establish this and it's too late to move on and switch things up. I don't want to look like a failure to all my peers and colleagues even though I very well know that I am deep down and am just trying to desperately hide it. Besides, I don't really have much interest in anything else, so what could I even switch to? 

I've taken some vacation days lately and I feel so much more refreshed not having to go to work. But I find that even in these days off, I don't have the motivation to do anything productive. I want to spend my time in bed, watching movies, playing games. I tried to clean my room but it seems so overwhelming to get up and make these changes. I'm still living at home with my parents at the moment but we don't get along super well as there are cultural and generational differences, and also with the lockdown, seeing them 24/7 in a tight space hasn't been ideal. In my personal life, I'm in a very happy relationship. I feel so supported and loved by my partner and the days where I get to be with them are when I truly feel like weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I don't have a care in the world. I wish I could stop time in those moments and just take it all in forever. So if that's the case and I can even feel that degree of happiness... am I to blame for everything else going wrong in my life? Am I just too lazy to make changes for myself?",2021-03-22 21:14:21
maqj0g,"I'm just done, I'm just fucking done. My life feels so empty seems like I don't have a purpose. For the sake of getting things done, I do the same shit everyday. I tried to get a hobby but I did get bored easily. I waste my fucking time doing nothing. I did have a few friends and now all of a sudden they too are ignoring me. They don't reply to my texts. I'm 19 and I've been single throughout my whole life. It's just a fact that no one likes me not even my parents. In real life, I do mess things up which kinda creates a bad impression about me in other people. They don't like to talk, share their opinions with me even if we are in the same group in Group Discussion. To be honest I'm not a boastful person but seeing the attitudes of my fellas I do feel that it's too much. I don't think I can take this anymore. May be I don't have the perfect motivation to die but in time I would have the energy necessary to take the ultimate decision that will finally free my soul from the body.

maqdvo,"i am considering suicide because student loans. 

I didn't graduate. i should have but i just stopped communicating with my senior project advisor. i dont think he really cares that much because he hasnt reached out all semester. i just took an unofficial leave of absence. 

im afraid everyone thinks im a liar or a freak because when i open up, i overshare. im convinced none of my 'friends' actually like me. 

ive become the scapegoat of my alchoholic parents (who seem to enjoy getting mad at the little things) and even my siblings have noticed im like the least favorite. the dynamic wasn't always like this. when im depressed (especially when i was on Wellbutrin) i was lashing out and picking fights all the time. my mother and i were constantly CONSTANTLY making eachother miserable. she ignored me and refused to speak to me for 2 months. both parents work from home so it was miserable. i tried to keep my head up qnd finish my college shit but i just couldn't stop thinking about dying. does not help that my screenplay(sr project) is about a woman with a terrible relationship with her mother. it made it really really hard to write. so much shame around that unfinished project. 

talked to my doctor and switched fron wellbutrin to zoloft. no difference. i just sleep more now. 

im unemployed, but i tried to start my own jewelry buisness but im met with consistent disappointment and discouragement by my parents. i just feel like a loser. i know i have a problem with self victimization, but oh my god. like getting a 'minimum wage' job is so soul sucking and the culture of my old job was so toxic--it feels impossible to even do basic things and maybe if i got a job that would be better? but also maybe not? and always wanted a job in a creative field but im lost and now have no college connections to even begin.  

i also have pretty disabling ADHD. i feel trapped. i have $500 in savings and im 23 and living at home. i feel like such a small little worm and i would be better off dead to get the loans off my back. i wouldn't have to face the failure of not graduating. i don't know what my next steps are. i think a lot about saving for a van qnd traveling but even then i need to make money. 

im so lost. i try to reach out to friends but i genuinely think people get tired of hearing how depressed you are. like. i made earrings for my friend and she hasn't texted me in a month--we were supposed to move to brooklyn together. 

sorry this is a mess but im a mess. im medicated, meditating, journaling but i still feel pointless and trapped and have no friends. like at least I'll die hot? in my prime years?

now suddenly my mum is very conscious of my brother's mental health. like she's VERY conscious. she doesn't want him to hear them argue. will act like nothing happened infront of him and all that

I know theres nothing i can do about it now, but i cant move on. I feel an enormous amount of guilt and regret, and i know if my depression had been managed better things would have been different.

I try not to be ncie but I always end up agreeing to them. I always pretend in front of my relatives that I don't like maybe it's because they didn't love me that much as my brother and sister and I noticed it . I'm the middle child. It was the same with my grandparents. I hate having guests. I hate going outside. I hate talking to people. When I want to tell my parents my problem something always happens and I don't do it then. And after some days of feel nothing the only emotions I cane xpress is sadness and anger. I get angry alot expecially on my brother. I want to be a good sister like I used to but its too hard. I've been used, been bullied and every time I made a friend they left. And once I finally made best fiends I had to move to another country. I have suicidal thoughts.

I see my life in episodes where for long periods of time I function fine, am happy, am very sociable, with only minor setbacks - and then long periods where I have severe depression and anxiety and can not seemingly escape. I don’t know what the “epiphanies” are. 

Problem: I have been with a wonderful partner for the past 6 years, who has experienced all my mental and physical ups and downs. We are going to get married soon, but a big worry of mine is that I don’t know how to appropriately involve them in my struggles. 

Frankly, they are supportive in a lot of ways, and have undoubtedly contributed positively to my life, but when I am experiencing severe depression / anxiety episodes they don’t know what to do / how to help. I can feel the rift developing between us, but if I can’t help myself, I don’t know how to get others to help me. And, the end result is that I push them away/experience everything alone.

maphdz,"It's debatable whether this post should be posted here but we'll see. So I'm a student and I should care about my results in school especially during semester and the following one however I seem to care less and less. I began not caring about school around the 7th of February. The only issue is that If this continues my life will ehm fall apart completely which I would be fine with if there wouldn't be a single person who cares about me. Unfortunately for me there are ppl who care so I cant just disappear or do something along those lines.   


On a sidenote: with me not caring and not really wanting to do the assignments or doing things that are related to school isn't only more difficult because I don't give a fuck but because me learning lots of things that I ""need"" is just useless. I'm not going to work in biology nor speak german (like ever) neither will I have a job which is related to literature(tbh I would love to) or arts or music... and then there is the classic answer that at least I was always given ""general knowledge blahblahblah""   
I'm feeling sick of those BS answers teachers used to give when anybody asked. They are all evasive...  
   
Don't tell me that a guy who can't even copy a relatively ""bad"" picture from his classmate will ever have any value in learning how to draw. Every single hour will be painful (was painful for me that I had to spend time irl with arts since we aren't in school about 85% of students cheat the rest actually have future in it). The same can be said about lots of other subjects however in those most stuff you have to learn is only good for your factual knowledge which won't write you poems neither will it help you in anything else. It's only good to flex in front of your friends or to answer quizzes well which if you aren't in a place alike to school isn't that impressive. Also there is a famous sentence regarding factual knowledge: ""google is your friend"".  


All I'm saying is that if I don't give a flying fuck there are suddenly a lot more reasons for me to just keep on not caring about school.  


If I don't perform well in something I will not end up getting a job and if that happens I won't have money to buy food after that it's only a matter of time when I'll end up dead... and well I really don't know if I want to die due to hunger... I'd rather kill myself instead of feeling that much pain but then again we are at the same situation as we were in paragraph 1 where I wrote I won't disappear or anything along those lines. so how do I change my attitude to which it was like in 2020 or just before february?

I once had a similar mindset in grade 8 and 7 what had to happen for me to have a mental reset was that the year ended. Somehow I didn't fail in anything despite not doing a single thing. However now my grades have to be decent at worst otherwise I will have extremely low chances of getting into uni...  


note: I only have 2 friends with one we only text each other but with the other we used to be in calls regularly (even prior to covid) and I feel like nowadays he doesn't even read my messages. Absolutely no reaction whatever I write to initiate a conversation or a call. I don't know what I did to him but I guess he has some grudge or something cause he wasn't ignoring me for a whole month before.

When I would see her we wouldn't really talk about much anymore because I'm not that talkative of a person.

mapgt6,"I’ve been depressed for an intensely long time. A lot of that time I figured I was just being ungrateful and that I had no idea just how good I had it (as my dad always said when I was growing up). It wasn’t until high school that I figured out I had actual problems that had been neglected for a long time.

I could usually keep a grip on it but I had a particularly bad string of fate where nearly everything came crashing down: my first girlfriend had told me she was a lesbian and didn’t care about me at all, my dog had died after he got cancer, and my parents went through a very messy and drawn-out divorce that forced me to be the middle-man between them.

I began talking to my school counselor after my friends insisted I do so, and after a handful of visits he suggested a checkup at my local doctor’s office. When I went in the following weekend I was asked a few questions and got condemned into a mental hospital that day and is where I would spend the entirety of my Christmas vacation (as this happened early December).

I was brought to a temporary cell where I waited for transfer to the proper hospital by ambulance, and it was one of the most uncomfortable nights I’ve ever had. I was not permitted outside of my room except to use the bathroom, I was completely alone with the exception of a nurse checking on me about once every 8 hours, and I would be forced to listen to other patients scream and smash their heads against the walls for several hours, wailing about how they didn’t want to be strapped down.

When I actually got brought to the hospital I was stripped of most of my belongings with the exception of a pair of crocs I had to get since laced shoes were contraband. We had a rigid schedule of taking a shower in the morning, checking in for breakfast, taking medication and/or getting screened, going to class (as we were still students and were expected to act as such), lunch, assertion training (where they taught communication skills), fitness, second screening, dinner, and then free time. You were not trusted with anything so you would have to check out your hygienic items for a shower/brushing your teeth and check them back in at the front desk. The areas you were permitted to be were incredibly small with electrical doors dividing nearly every part of the hospital.

The doctors will never tell you what the broadcasted terms meant but we quickly found out that certain codes (I believe it was ‘code purple’ but I can’t remember now) meant a suicide attempt and we would hear those go off all the time. On average you’d hear about 5 ‘code purples’ a day, and if you were lucky it would be during the day rather than when you’re trying to sleep.

Every now and then you could get a visitor and meet them in a small room (usually the library in our wing) for about 10 minutes to talk about whatever. Many patients likely appreciated visitors but I always hated it. Seeing people emotional about me always makes me uncomfortable. I can’t particularly relate to it and it just leaves me to sit there and watch them, something I don’t like doing.

I wanted nothing to do with the place as it left me deeply disturbed and uncomfortable, so I would typically lie during my screenings to make it look like I was making rapid progress in my treatment to get out. Since you were considered mentally unfit to leave you were locked inside and could not leave until you’re considered fixed. Luckily I’ve always been a likable person so the screeners figured I had regained confidence and was seen as fit to leave early.

I was not, but I have zero intention of letting them know that.

Thankfully I was 17 at the time so I got put in the teenager section, but if I had gone just a few months after I would’ve turned 18 and would be condemned to the general section where everything is much worse.

I still have long depressive spells but they haven't been so bad as to just make me fully shut down like this since the meds started. It's been over two weeks now and I can't handle it.

I wish there was a way to like, commit yourself even though your not a risk to yourself/to have no stigma and record of the hospitalization. I feel like I need immediate help but I don't know what that help needs to be or would look like, I feel generally safe with myself, I just can't function and like I'm literally losing my mind. I feel like such a failure and that no one will understand or take it seriously if I say I need a break. 

I did email my behavioral health team this morning, hoping I get a response soon. Is there anything they may be able to give me to supplement what I'm already doing (currently 200 mg lamictal, 50 mg zoloft, 20mg adderall, and 1mg ativan as needed for occasional panic attacks)? i feel like they're going to tell me to just take my ativan but even if it takes the edge off for a little while it's not going to help my productivity and I'm ruining my life right now. Just curious if anyone has had any experience with something that helped them at least somewhat snap out of it for a little while. I just want to finish a few goddamn assignments and take a shower. Not sure if I have any real options but to just ride it out, though.",2021-03-22 20:10:09

So I was at my grandma's house, pretty down as always. We were talking about humanity and how life is only a cycle of pain (I brought up the topic), after discussing a lot she gave it an end and told me with a hurt voice; ""You used to be so happy"". It really hurt me, since I can not remember this feeling, I just feel the numbness (It's painful in a different way).

Over the last year, my partner has fully supported me, we got into a lot of debt with Covid, I had several  mental breakdowns and slept a lot. Really let him down. I had surgery for endometriosis. I was a hermit that used every wrong coping skill. I'm slowly re entering life, and trying to get comfortable with it. We sleep in separate bedrooms, and plan to keep riding this out together until I'm financially independent. Keeping this job, is so important. I'll be working as a hostess. I'm embarrassed because I feel like I should be doing something more important. But I want to be the best damn hostess I can be. It's the number one hotel in my city. Room rates like 700 a night.

maon4v,"I'm 25 years old, never tried anything like posting here or anywhere similar before, but I just feel like I need an outlet somehow and I got noone to turn too except a loving mom and dad, which just doesn't always cut it, I'm not sure this will either, I'm not even sure I'll be posting this but just writing it may help my current state of mind a bit. Don't get me wrong, I love my parents but they can't help me with this. Only I can, and this is just part of that process. 

2 days ago I experienced a minor heart attack on a silly combination of drugs that I even knew could be dangerous, I guess I just don't care enough anymore. It was my first and last experience with a synthetic cannabinoids tho, so seeing as I won't do it again maybe I do Care a bit.
It was not serious enough to call 911, by my own calculations, but it surely had my re-evaluate my priorities. I still have a slight pain in the heart, here 2 days later but nothing to bad. I don't want to get too much Into that part, it was just something that happened and that I dealt with like I always deal with the unexpected, calm and collected with deep breaths. It was a strange hour tho with pulse ranging from 55 all the way up to 180 multiple times and decently bad pain in the heart, I was completely red in the face and could feel the beat of my heart in my eyes and ears, there where so much pressure on my face was tingling from the blood flowing through. 
And before you wonder if it was just drug induced paranoia then no, I'm extensively trained in recreational use of drugs, and never had any bad reaction before, but this was a new substance with a record of beeing potentially deadly in to big doses, luckily I was aware and kept my doses very low. Actually the problem came multiple hours after I took it, long after the effects where gone. 

Never experienced anything like it before, I'm generally of great health. . 
I'm sure it happened because of the drug combination I was taking. 

Anyway. 

Ive always been more or less without friends, not by choice but by life circumstances, as a kid i would move about 20 times till I hit the age of 16, so I don't have any old friends that knew me as a kid, no background history with anyone except brief moments here and there with alot or different people. 
It's a long story about how i ended up moving that much but most of it starts when I'm 10 and the state decides that I have to go live in a place for fked up kids, like really fucked up kids, I'm talking sexually abused ones and what's worse. I never understood what I was doing there. I don't come from a bad upbringing per say. Sure was not a dance on roses always but I was never beaten or abused and have 2 loving parents that will do anything for me. 


This decision was based solely on the reason that I didn't fit into school, because I had a hard time sitting still in class, I was never achedemically behind tho, actually quite in front and this is probably  the reason I didn't care for class. I didn't feel like they taught me anything, I already knew the math, I understood the grammar and I just felt it beeing a constant repitition of useless stuff. I still do to this day. Atleast the elementary school. Higher levels can be interesting. 
I spend 6 years on various homes like this, under huge frustration from myself and my family, untill the same state decided that it was actually a mistake putting me there in the first place. Talk about fucking up a young life haha. 
Spending age 10-16 under such circumstances gave me no real insight in what it Means to live a normal life, we where pretty much secluded from the outside. I never went to elemantary school except the first few grades and the last grade where I joined a local school only for the exams.

We where Only allowed to leave the area supervised by people paid to deal with us. I ran off often, found some friends in the nearby areas but again, never developed anything lasting. I got into some bad stuff around age 15, doing theft and occasionally violence and have also landed myself a few short stays in prison, longest one beeing a year. 
I mean I know of alot of people, but never got that one friend that lasted. Well  I had, maybe, one but I fucked that up myself, in the search for something more. More on that later. 

In my teenage life, after I got dismissed from those crazy kid homes, I was quite a rebel and lived outside the law for a while, hence always hiding my identity, giving people fake names when they asked who I was and making sure I wasn't recognized for what I did (dealing). This didn't excactly help to grow my circle as I'm sure you can understand :) I simply didn't know how to fit in except by having a role of a supplier of good times. In a sense I still don't, im just done with drug dealing. 
At this age I had already felt like I had to take care of myself for many years and nothing anyone could tell me would change my mind. I didn't trust people, and still have a hard time doing it. It's getting alot better tho. 

 I had a few friends that I went through this with, one of em I met on one of these homes, the last one, as 16 year old and another I met by fronting him a bit of drugs when I was 17-18
We just stuck together and handled whatever the world brought us. Beeing in this world was easy, I would always be busy 24/7 and always with multiple people, but obviously not deeply connected, mainly connected by the money we where making and spending together. It worked tho, I felt a bit of happiness, probably for the first time in my life, superficial, but still there.
 I was living in my own spot in a prime location of my capital, partying all the time and just blasting through money like there was no tommorow, trying to buy some satisfaction. Never really worked for me tho, maybe i didn't buy the right things..
 It's actually amazing I managed to stay out of addiction (except weed), seeing multiple of my acquaintances go down that road, and they even had friends and girlfriends that cared. All of em seem to do well today tho, except for me beeing lonely like never before.  I'm not in contact with any of em, for different reasons, money and trust beeing the main killer of friendships in my late teen/adult life

I'm actually not the typical kind of person you would find in that world, I never even planned to go there, it just ended up happening. I'm a bookworm, computer geek, not a gamer but I been using the internet for financial gains since I was around 16.
Quite spiritual, enjoy meditation and psychedelics and generally broadening my perception of consciousness in any way I can. I'm also not like average Joe in my perception and beliefs and that can surely be a hard pill to swallow for some, making it rare that I find someone I'm on wavelength with. 
I have never had problems with finding myself inside a new group of people quickly, it's the only way I know of connecting, but these days that is not easy, seeing that no groups are allowed :) also these connections never grow deep, whenever the group ain't together I'm back at beeing alone. 

During this time I meet a girl, actually one of my acquaintances partner at the time, and we click together really well all 3 of us. We spend tons of time together all 3 for multiple years. I even went to jail to protect her from getting sentenced from a stash they found at her place, hence my 1 year stay. I'm loyal to the end and would rather take time for someone then rat em out. The second I don't feel that same loyalty go back I'm done with the person tho. I don't need shallow connections except when I'm taking my group persona on, which is not the actual me, but it's beneficial fof keeping some sort of contact with people.

A few years and bad decisions later im with the girl instead, my friend and I don't speak anymore for obvius reasons. I might add that they had ended it themselves a good while before but still, it's not how bros do to eachother, but I was desperate for affection, feeling a deep connection with someone for the first time in my life. And it was mutual, I almost couldn't believe it. Sometimes I question how mutual it actually was, having my limited experience with close relationships of any kind, I had nothing to gauge it by. 
We spend a few years together on/off, mainly on.. Seeing eachother multiple times a week atleast and often stayed together for weeks at a time, but it never really developed into something lasting. I think she wasn't truly Interested, atleast only at times, I was supporting her financially and in all other ways I could, while she was in a bad time of her life, I see that now and have for a while.  
Sure there where times where it felt real, for both of us, but it never lasted more then some days, then we wouldn't see eachother for couple days or maybe a week and I felt like I had to start all over next time. She was never interested in confirming that we where together, neither wanted to meet my family tho she gladly showed me hers. It was an emotional Rollercoaster I never hope to experience again. I should probably have ended it earlier for my own sake. There where signs and times where I wanted to, but I couldn't bring myself to do it, making myself lonely again. 


She's very different from me, have a huge group of people around her and I don't think she knows what lonely means, tho she likes to act like it. But I mean, she can't go 10 minutes without someone trying to contact her, I can go multiple years in a row... I'm also not needy of alot of people around me, I enjoy beeing alone at times, when it's a choice, not a given. I do need deep connections tho. Just 1, I can't go through life as a singularity. 

Anyway it's no about her, but she's definately part of why I feel like I do these past few days.  She ended up starting a long distance relationship with someone she met online, from another country. I felt very betrayed, mainly cause I knew they had been in contact for along time while I was with her too. And one day she just stopped caring about me, even to the extend of asking me to be quite last time I visited her, while I was cooking dinner for her, cause this dude was calling and she didn't want him to hear I was there, that's the last time I saw her, now I didnt want to be involved anymore, so I ended our contact with a broken heart. I couldn't handle more of it. I actually just left the plates of food and got out more or less. I remember I forgot some of my stuff and had to go back for it. I was pretty devastated.

I mean, I did kinda know it was comming, but beeing so damn needy of any kind of affection I just tried to let it pass. She had been doing things like this online before, but I was always a part of it, and it wasn't something I had issues with prior. This time was different tho. 
That was another big hit to my trust issues. I can't fathom how and why people do that to eachother. It's not even possible for me to play such games with other people. If I have the slightest interest in someone else I'm already gone. I've had multiple girls during my time, it's not like I lived in celibacy but always short periods and then a new. And often long in between. Nobody I kept in touch with. 

This is just when Covid hit the world BTW. 

Now I'm back to beeing all alone, the state of existence I'm most familiar with, but now it felt so much worse, I had been given a taste of what life could be. What it was like to share the road with someone, to actually care and feel like someone cared back, to share highs and lows.

Back at Noone to share my experience with, Noone to laugh with, Noone to do anything with really, which just isn't fun, I get my energy from beeing with other people and making them happy. I love to cook, and to host people generally, I'm a joker and extrovert, and truly need  deep connections and understandings to thrive and feel like Im developing, but I've lost my way of finding them.

It was a hard blow, and I dealt with it the only way I know. I started working alot, mostly alone or with family and smoking alot of weed + often taking doses of psychedelics in the evenings. Basicly anything to keep my mind occupied cause whenever it's not, i feel like shit. Now that feeling is trumping tho. I can barely occupy my mind, I stopped making money online and stopped having a online persona, I basicly stopped doing all I cared about and now just work a Job I don't enjoy to put numbers in a bank, so I can spend em on stuff I don't enjoy either... It's a bad circle to be caught in. 

Fast forward a year and im still in the same state of mind, alone, bored and unable to pick myself out of it. Economically I'm not in a bad spot, I mean I'm not a millionaire but I'm comfortable, I just don't know what do with it. I've had alot of money as a young one too, way way more then now, or atleast a much bigger flow, but that never gave me true happiness, only slight moments of joy. The only thing I can think about lately is moving to another country and start fresh. Out there I would just be the guy from a foreign country. That's something to work from. I could dig up my pc and start Making some dough online again. Go swim with some awesome fish, or whatever. Just smth. 

A few days ago Girl calls me again, after a year of no contact, to say she's sorry about how she treated me and thank me for all I did for her, but also tell me to please block her number, so she can't call me again because I'm not good for her. Mind you, this is after a year of abselutely no contact. That didn't excactly make me feel better. To have the only person I ever been really close with call me and tell me I'm bad for her for no apparent reason, when all I ever done Is sacrifice my self for her in any way I know, and sure, maybe I just didn't have enough to give, considering my quite traumatic life 10-16.
Anyway she's moving out of country, and I'm genuinely happy for her. This call spirals me down to a even worse mood then I'm already in tho, that is the day before my heart issue. 

Now I truly feel alone, I mean I did also before but this pulled the plug on the last energy I had to keep a smile going.

During my heart issue I was thinking about my life, I was not afraid that I might die, for more then a few seconds, when it was at its worst. But it still got me thinking. How unfulfilled I actually am and how bad it would suck for my life to Continue like this. I think I've been burying it away under intellectual stimuli for a long time. I don't want to go back to that. Now I just want to fix it. I know I can, I just don't know how. It's like I only been given 10% of the tools to build the house, but all the materials is there right in front of me and I have to invent the hammer myself as I go by. I'm sure many people feel like this to some extend, hypothetically speaking, personal relationships is hardly easy for anyone, but without practice nothing gets better and I don't even know where to start. 

I actually feel a bit better about it all as I sit here and write, it makes me realize that I have always done everything I know to be the best version of me I can, and while that isn't always perfect, or even close, it's a damn good start. 

I really believe moving to another country could help me, but at the same time I'm also afraid to get stuck in the same rhythms there, cause then I'd just be even more alone. Overall I'm trying to maintain a positive mindset, but some days its just harder then other.

Im not even sure this post belong in here, I'm not clinically depressed, just stuck in a bad spot. Neither am I really looking for help, i mean, our burdens is always our own to deal with somehow and I think what I mostly need is to snap out of it and get some joy back in my life. 

Regardless, thanks for taking time to read this, I'm not really expecting much from Posting this. I'm not actually familiar with this sub, I only saw it when someone reffered it as a joke to someone else's comment in Wallstreetbets. I have great respect for people using there time to try help other with there problems tho. I've seen so many people pretending to do that just cause they had a job in the sector, during my early life. I know this place is different in that regards and that's a great thing. 

I'll post this from a burner reddit for my own anonymitys sake.. This is not stuff I usually share, and least of all with the internet, but I just need a change and what do I even have to lose",2021-03-22 19:47:22
maoiub,"Hello, from time to time I have thoughts about death bringing me a relief, I am not actively suicidal, never tried and probably never will, I am not diagnosed with depression, but posting here since I assumed that this community knows a lot about the topic.

Long story short I have episodes of insomnia, sleepless nights and am compensating it during the day, mostly sleeping 1.5 - 3 hours 2 times a day, I also tend to oversleep some days, like 11hours of sleep a day. I feel something like internal void, like I fear future and that it will be grey. I sometimes look on a crane outside my flat's window and think about jumping from it, I do not pay much attention to those thoughts because I know I have family and partner that rely on me and doing it would be pretty selfish and non-considerate of me.Today my red light went on when I noticed that I didn't care about car approaching the pedestrian crossing and I rushed on it, with car being not so many meters away, it stopped and I knew it would probably stop without a problem, but I didn't care if it did.

mao2pi,"This is how I felt before:

I felt like failure no goals, ambitions, friends and that empty feeling in my chest. You know the one. I hated myself and asked myself why am I not normal? Why am I not happy?  I had that feeling in my chest and I wanted to kill myself. I felt anxiety when walking outside and constantly worrying what strangers, friends or familiy thought of me.

I don't know what happened but now I feel completely different. I just don't care. Here is how I feel now:

I simply don't want anything and also I don't care. I simply don't give a shit. I feel like I'm at peace and I will accept whatever life throws at me. If I died tomorrow I wouldn't care.  I accept my meaningless life in this meaningless universe and I feel at peace. I have some goals I'm working towards but I only work at them because I have to do something, you know? I don't want human connection. I don't want power or a girlfriend.

I simply accept that. It's a weird feeling. No longer do I care what people think of me. I see people as greedy and selfish beings that judge each other by looks, money and status. I simply accept that.

Like I don't give a shit what a dog thinks about me and I don't get mad when he breaks something. That's just the way he is and I accept him and love him for that. That's the way I see humans now I expect nothing from them. I expect nothing from anything.

I just feel....idk how to explain this. Sorry if I repeat myself but I simply don't care about anything and I don't have that feeling in my chest.

I just accept myself as this being that doesn't care about anything and I don't know it's a weird feeling.

mantem," for the past like 2 years now, I just go through my days like someone else is living in my body, it feels like fog/underwater is the best way I can describe it, when bad things happen to me its still fog, when good things happen to me its still fog, one day bleeds into the next, I most likely dont have depression(or maybe this is it?) I have a job as a physical therapist and trainer and I am really happy it was my dream job since I was a teen, but it feels wrong, I dont know in the past month it has gotten much worse, I feel like I am going to die soon, I am perfectly healthy but I dont know, I think that because I am doing something wrong the universe is trying to ""get rid"" of me, I have a partner who I love really much but when I bring it up she says not to worry (both of us are usually like that) but right now it just feels not right, even though I am really happy everyday my days feel empty.

PS- I dont do drugs, dont drink, sometimes smoke when the ""fog"" gets really bad.",2021-03-22 19:10:00

mankam,"so. my bf has been struggling for depression for around 4-5 years now. and we've been dating for 11 months. theres 11 days to our first year together. things have been rough. its started since december 2020 tbh. the first few months we started dating seems like a dream now. we used to talk 24/7 and spend lots of time tgt and had fun. now we talk little compared to how much we used to when we first started dating and the mood has just been very negative. we have had arguements (more like conversations where we just let everything spill and cry) more lately. he keeps saying he doesnt deserve me and that he just wants to die because he hates seeing me like this. as in me being sad a lot whenever we're texting because hes been taking long to reply even when hes online because hes been talking to other people, which hurts, since it seems like im no longer his priority yk? but we talked about it and hes been answering quicker lately. recently he also said he wants to be a better person but he knows he cant, and that he just wants to be what we used to be when we first started dating. a big portion of why we havent been talking is because hes been playing a ton with his other friends. hes playing rn and he just told me he just wants to die and i dont know what to do. he called himself useless and stuff like that. therapy isnt helping either. i really dont know what to do. im sorry if this post is in a mess. i guess im just letting my feelings and thoughts spill. i know he hasnt been exactly treating me right either. he said it himself too and that he wants to treat me better too but the message he was kind of giving of was that he cant. we're in a mess rn. thanks if you read this all the way. this post is in a mess. im in a mess. hes in a mess. we're in a mess",2021-03-22 18:58:08

You can't help someone
Who doesn't want to help himself. 


I was in a relationship too. He was a mess, and i was dragged into it. I thought it was my responsibility to make him okay. Only to found out that it was his battle, and not mine.

maniw4,I've always had a difficult relationship with my mother. I just can't reason with her and make her understand my feelings. I used to tolerate everything thinking that she is mentally ill. But it's become too much of a challenge right now. She won't let me go out meet my friends or maintain any kind of relationship with my other relatives. She hates everybody I love. I am a college student and I've only a few more months to finish college. Before pandemic I honestly had a better relationship with her because we used to live in different cities and I only used to meet her on weekends or I would call her on the phone. But for the last few months we moved in together. (She used to live in a separate house where she worked and moved back in cuz of her schizophrenic episode) whenever I suggest moving out now she emotionally blackmails me. I honestly do feel bad for her cuz she's my mother. But it's becoming hard to love her. I don't know what will happen if I seriously decide to move in with a relative who has graciously offered to help me. My dad is also okay with me moving out. But I don't know how to deal with the effect it will have on my mom. Right now I want to focus on my life cuz I've got a lot to study. its hard to focus on myself being in the same house as my mother cuz she always barge into my room and picks a fight with me all the time.,2021-03-22 18:56:14
mangvd,I want revenge against this world for giving me the body I have now. For making me so powerless that all I can do is complain on reddit. For hampering or ruining any attempt I make to try to change things for the better. At this point living a good life is impossible so i don't want to hear that suggestion anymore. Every day I find something new to hate to the point of where anger is the only emotion I experience and there is nothing that can get rid of it aside from getting revenge. I will find a way to have my revenge and no one will stop me.,2021-03-22 18:53:26

mangbj,"Hey I'm wondering have antidepressants helped many people with PDD/dysthymia? I thought I had major depression a few years ago but it's been a near constant low grade level since. I tried a few different medications a few years back when first seeking treatment but none helped at all and I haven't tried another in a few years. I went to therapy for about one year and was doing a bit better but things seem to have stagnated and I can't shake this low level of depression which makes me apathetic and not really able to enjoy life properly while still technically functioning. 

Do medications not work as well for dysthmia/am I doomed to have this for the rest of my life? Just wondering do I need to try something else or is it likely to not work for me since I haven't responded to others (have tried different categories (ssri, snri, a mood stabiliser) and dosages etc) Feeling pretty hopeless about it would love to hear if people have recovered or found anything that really helps?",2021-03-22 18:52:44
grt89ks,Medications work best when your also seeing a therapist. That being said they can still help but you have to be willing to work on changing your perspective during depressive times which can be very difficult to do alone. Journaling is a good cheap option to monitor moods and how medication is helping. Also keep in mind you need to be on a medication for a good few months to really see a change,2021-03-22 19:32:19
grt8p6l,"Have you tried taking antidepressants in conjunction with routine therapy? There are studies that highly suggest a regimen of medication alongside therapy to help with depression - whether it’s better for dysthymia or MDD, I truly can’t say, but as a personal and non-professional suggestion I think it’s worth looking into both together, if it’s an option.",2021-03-22 19:35:42
grtejdj,Yeah I think I do need s to work on changing my perspective a bit which can be difficult but it does seem that this feeling is going to be part of my life forever but hopefully not. I was on a couple of those medications for several months some while in therapy and really never noticed any positive effect from them but did have some bad side effects,2021-03-22 20:20:50
grtf656,I was on some antidepressant while in therapy but never got a positive effect from them and I was on some for a few months at a time. I had some bad side effects on one and another was horrible to come off while the other one did nothing so the whole experience of trying and coming off and never having benefited has really turned me off trying another. I know sometimes people find one that works after a few that don't but maybe they just aren't for me. Don't know if I need to keep trying them/return to therapy/come off contraception I am a bit at a loss haha,2021-03-22 20:25:28

I lost my mother to cancer. It’ll be 3 years in April. I am still grieving and when that time approaches, it’s unbearable. 
Unrelated to her death is my PTSD. I had a near death experience (trees falling on my house while I slept, ceiling caved in on me and one part of the tree landed on the bed missing me by inches. I had to crawl out of my house only to have more trees falling around me (ice storm) and it was terrifying. 
I’m not on any medication and the counselor I did have ghosted me a few months ago. 
Anyway, I had a trigger this morning while I was going to work and I had a panic attack. I called my work (lied about why I couldn’t come in) and now I’m home. My anxiety is so bad that I physically can’t leave my house. I texted my husband to let him know what was going on. He’s trying to be helpful but he told me it’s all in my head. “Go to the beach, go to a park, etc. I love that he’s trying to help but telling me to leave the house is not helping. 
I have an appointment scheduled with my family doctor for next week. I don’t know what else to do. 
Some days I can fake a smile. I can fake being ok. I can actually do my job well. The whole time I’m screaming in pain on the inside.

malvxi,"Hey guys, I've recently been prescribed with 15mg of mirtazapine and 0.25mg of alprazolam (xanax). I'm meant to take mirtazapine every night and alprazolam only when necessary. 

It's my fourth day on meds and I'm super tired and drowsy all the time. I sleep for more than half a day and even after my sleep I still feel super weak. I did a bit of research and apparently thats one of the side effects but approx. when will the tiredness end and the meds be effective? I have work and classes and it sucks being tired all the time. I already have concentration issues and I'm alr tired all the time so being even more tired than i was before kinda sucks lol.  

Also, how will i know the medicine is truly working? Also asking this out of curiosity, what happens if someone who doesnt have depression/anxiety is on mirtazapine and alprazolam? Will it simply do nothing to them?",2021-03-22 17:32:36
grtf2a4,"Xanax is only working against anxiety so you should be taking it whenever you feel overly anxious, and judging by the text, you are extremely anxious about your meds right now, so you should probably take some.
It will not work immediately but in time it will let you be less anxious about everything at the cost of your concentration and it will make you feel even more sleepy and tired

I get the point of enjoying good memories but I always feel bad for those who were not apart of the memory and the fact these past events seem to be a basis for the conversation is very common.

Events that happened weeks/months ago seems like a distant memory for them, when I cant help but remember so many details from it that I wouldn't see the need to bring it up in conversation. To me it sounds like a repetitive loop always hearing the same stories each time we are together with the same structure of conversation, becoming a little bit of an annoyance.

I really don't know how I will bring it up or what I should say, and am worried in the moment I will feel too anxious and end up not saying anything.

I had my very first consultation, psych told me it was depression with psychosis. Today is my first day taking meds for this. I tried going on for three years straight ignoring the signs and coping on my own but not this time, not anymore. 

I'm on three medications to start it all off, anti-psychotic, anti-depressants, and anti-parkinson. All three of them are to be dosed everyday for tye next two weeks until my follow up session with the same psychiatrist. 

It'll be a long battle as the psych told me not to expect any changes with the medicines prescribed, they'll only grow results after the next session takes place provided that i can stay faithful with what she has given me.

I can’t take care of myself. It’s like my life force has been sucked out of me. It’s been like this for far too long, a complete loss of the will to live.

I can’t do anything for myself. Getting up to do anything is a chore. I work but am always hanging on by a thread. I muster up all the energy I possibly can (and it’s not much) just to make it to work and then when I do, I get no work done because I can’t think and I can’t concentrate and I have absolutely no motivation to push myself through it.

I just turned 27, i’m not getting any younger. I’m getting less and less attractive by the day. Put on 50 pounds over the last year. I don’t feel beautiful...not that I ever did. Now i’m just uglier than I was before. I used to enjoy pampering myself, doing skincare and makeup...now i’ll go days without washing my damn face. 

I have dirty dishes sitting in my sink for days. Dust and trash cover the floors. I moved into this apartment 6 months ago and I was so excited because it was my first apartment. I still have not unpacked. All of my shit is still in boxes. It’s been 6 freaking months. Unbelievable. 

I can’t get myself to do anything. I feel like i’m sedated every waking moment. I can sleep for 6 hours or 16 hours, it doesn’t matter. I’m tired of always being tired for no damn reason. I am tired of always feeling weak and exhausted and like I just need to lay down. There is nothing medically wrong with me, i’ve gotten checkup after checkup. 

I’m just depressed. For no reason. And i’m not here for it. Can’t kill myself, can’t find a way to live right. Wtf am I gonna do with myself. Somebody please end me.",2021-03-22 16:01:17
mak780,"Hi guys. I'm sorry if my English is bad but I just need a place to tell this.

I am currently 25, just finish uni last year and still jobless... With Covid 19 going on, I've tried really hard to find a job, but I just can't seem to get one.

Ive also haven't seen any of my friends since June 2020. And I also haven't seen my girlfriend for over 3 month now. Although I am always in contact with my girlfriend, but thats not the same case with my friends. Lately I feel like that my friends have abandoned me. I know they have their own life but its kinda clear that they don't want to be my friends anymore. We have a group where we chat together as group ans as soon as I enter the caht to join, they all stop talking and doesn't reply or acknowledge me in the chat.

All these things plus being alone for a long time really did something to me. 

When I was a kid, i think starting in 3rd  grade, Ive always had this feeling that I wasn't going to live very long (I felt that was going to die young), I wasn't going to get married cause nobody wants me and that I was going to be alone forever for the duration of my short life. Suicide was also one of the things thst would be part of the thought... This feeling I always have on my mind until I was 16 and then it stopped being the thing that was my focus. But its always there. Once in a while I would think about it and be sad. And now lately being alone so much, I've been thinking about it a bit too much.. I've lost 5kg in the span of 3 months. I keep forgetting to eat. I have trouble sleeping and I've kinda lost interest in the things I do. Everything is just ""meh"" now.. 

I really don't know what going on in my head or my life right now. I feel lost.. I've only ever told my girlfriend about this feeling that I have since I 3ed grade. No one else know about this. My girlfriend has been a big help in keeping me up to check. But as I mentioned before, it's been a while since I saw her.

I'm sorry guys if this is not the place for this. But I needed a place and I feel that I need to tell this to the world. To people that doesn't know me so that they don't judge me or make fun of me. Ive never told anyone else because in my country most people do not take these thing seriously. All the ever do is laugh at you, make fun of you and say this happen because I'm not religious enough.",2021-03-22 15:53:38

It's all one big money game.

The world would be a better place if money wasn't a requirement. The people I see living on the streets, treated like trash, nowhere to call home. What can they do about it? You need an address to get a job. The customers don't want some smelly homeless person ruining their shopping experience.

We take people and throw them in cells to rot. When we allow them to be free from their cage we brand them as a criminal. We take away their rights. Their rights to vote, to get a job. And what to do then? Noone wants to hire a criminal, a thief, a drug addict, a killer. What to do then. They have no choice but to break the rules, just to survive. Sucks for them I suppose, back in your cage you go.

Who cares if someone wants to smoke pot? If they want to do crack? They are only hurting themselves. Who are you to judge another?

We turn it into a problem when we label them. What are they to do? They cannot seek help lest they be turned in. Who can you trust? You can't just go to the store and buy some drugs (like alchohol) you have to make some shady deal. You could get laced, you could get hurt.

Marijuana was originally made illegal to stoke fear of the Mexican immigrants. Why is it still illegal? There is plenty of evidence proving that it was a decision purely based on racism. Yet people choose to disregard the irony. Why? Why bathe in such extreme ignorance?

None of us are free from sin so who are we to judge?

As far as advice goes, if you can fix things, try. If you cant, try and make peace with it. Sometimes things dont work out, we cant blame ourselves for everything. Were not perfect, nobody is, we shouldn't treat ourselves as if we are.",2021-03-22 17:45:02

majua3,"You know this voice inside your head?

The one you find when you're really young.

The one that points you in some directory.

The one you use to build your character.

The one who tells you who you are.

The one that recounts how your past is connected to your present.

The one that assumes how your future will be.

For me, I learned to trust this voice early.

After all, this voice is me.

And then, one day, you learn something which effects the start of your story.

Somewhere in the past, you learn about something that led you to multiple failures, from which you learned something new which is at the core of your personality.

But this past event, it changed, and you got a new perspective about it.

And all the failures after it.

Somehow they're no longer your.

And all the things you learned from these failures, they're not yours either.

But you know you lived a happy life.

But you also know that all these events led you here.

To the point you learned about this past event.

And then you're stuck in a sort of a memory loop.

You try to digest two different ways your past brought you to your present.

But you can't.

Now stay with me because it's about to become strange.

And then something breaks and the narrative changes.

It's like knowing who you were and who you want to be.

It's like your ego splits and you look at yourself from the side.

And then your voice changes.

The one you thought was you.

And it becomes destructive.

Let me share with you some of the symptoms I feel.

You feel this crushing guilt and sadness.

You no longer feel joy in anything you do.

You can't sleep at all at night without pills.

And your cognitive abilities, they changed.

You can recount your past perfectly up to the depression, but everything after it is mixed together.

Just another day you can't recall.

And these things you thought were easy like connecting simple actions, they become impossible.

It's a little like smoking weed.

You then sit at your computer to hear music, you click play, but there's no music, and then your mind clicks and you remember to put the headphones.
And you think to yourself, ""good weed"".

And when you think about the future, a minute, an hour, a day, a year.
It's like your mind knows it points to the future, but you somehow can't comprehend what these words mean or how far.

And you can no longer have conversations.

And when you ask your voice what's next, it doesn't answer.

It's confusing, really.

And the annhedonia is too much, because you can't escape.

So sleep is the only part that's left that gives you some silence.

And the world keeps spinning and another day arrives.

And you walk through this day as a shadow of yourself.

And everything is off.

Your mind is locked in a conflict about how to become yourself again.

You body reacts differently, it's moves are slow and everything is unfocused.

People react to you differently, when you talked you used to know how to respond.

But now you can't, the words they don't come out at the speed you're used to.

And your motivation is gone.

And all you can think about is how to become the person you used to be.

The one you could relate.

The one that had a past and present.

And could look into the future.

But it's impossible.

And what's strange is that one view I have survived.

Perhaps because it was always my core view.

And this view is nihilism.

I really built my life around it.

I bet you couldn't tell.

And the quote ""memento mori"" was always at the back of my mind.

What I did not know is that sometimes it's possible for your mind to die before your body.

And then you think that perhaps life is just a story that you tell yourself.

And while this story is intact you keep being yourself.

And when it breaks, you can no longer relate to this story.

So you take your core view and you ask yourself, your new self.

Can it be, that life is meaningless?
Just a series of events.

That lead you from your childhood to your death?

And what is death?

Is it the end of your body?
Or is it the end of your mind?

And you are one of the few that knows the answer.

After all, you experienced the death of your ego which is the same as the death of your mind.

And now you also got a different view about your old self.

So you look from the side.

And you understand how you got here.

I used to have these nights where I would wake up at 2:00 at night and go outside, roll a joint and smoke.
And I remember looking at the edge of the rolled paper, on the fiery part and something about it pulled me.
And I would then look at the stars and think about my life.
I will never forget these nights.

I've doing well and exceeding where I can, and even during covid induced online classes I've been holding up well  this semester however....I've just lost it. All that motivation I had before is just...gone. I dobt want to do this anymore...I just want to sleep.

It doesn't help that I'm off work waiting for a surgery to stop pain; so I spend a lot of time in bed waiting for the pain to stop enough so I can get homework done....but sometimes ill spend all day in bed just a mess because the pain won't stop no matter how many painkillers I down.

It also doesn't help that two of my classes this semester are things I really don't care about....one being web design/coding. I was excited for it in the beginning but as we've continued throughout the semester I'm just so disillusioned. It's hard and the prof teaches such basic stuff w no additional resources that I have no idea how to attempt the projects. It's really killing my brain. I can't sit at my desk for 4 hours figuring out how to do a specific line of code because my body pain just won't allow it 

Ugh. I just want it to be over...only about a month left, less than that even. Just a few more tests and a few more projects.........im just so tired of it all I just want to sleep forever.",2021-03-22 15:14:04

And not being able to answer such an easy question correctly 🙃 I'm a disappointment to my parents, I can't get a thing right. I can't even be confident with myself. My whole life is a joke. I feel like I failed in life because of this one question. It was fucking easy I was just too dumb to understand it. Fuck I should just die this is embarrassing. I thought I'd be able to get an A if I study hard enough. Ever since the beginning of the semester, I worked hard. I worked harder than anyone else. I studied when they played. I barely slept properly. But now that I can't even answer one goddamn question, I'm starting to question my worth in life. I have such bad luck in life it's unbelievable.

maj42g,"Whenever I feel pain, I close my eyes, sitting on a bus flying through the vastness of space with no destination  –  neither pain nor pleasure  –  total peace  –  in a world existing far away from our realm. It's like a distant call –  here we are  –  you are one of us.

That's what I feel when I close my eyes, I tried to get in in words, but this feeling is unexplainable - it drives me further and further to the edge - till where I don't want to live anymore.

This is just one of the feelings I have. I tend to self-destructive behaviour, not with harming myself with knives or whatever, I mean harming myself with alcohol and nicotine. I just want to feel something, even If it is the rush of nicotine in my brain or the peace of mind, when high. This reality feels kafkaesque – I'm at the point where everything is abstract, pointless and senseless.

I've been having these depressive times in a constant cycle. I'd feel bad, unmotivated, pointless to this place for several months. Then I'd be ok: ""let's just continue, nothing will change but I'm okay"". I still haven't told anything bout myself since I'm just here to get it off me, but yeah I'm a 17-Year-old boy from Switzerland, doing my bullshit apprenticeship as a merchant (in the 2nd year of 3 total).

I'm only able to get 4-6 hours of sleep since I don't want to feel the next day – It will be just the same bs as always. I'd be watching a kid-series or science fiction series to lose myself in their reality. I couldn't cry for a long long exhausting time, I'd feel sad but the tears wouldn't come, but yesterday I did, I watched a new series on Netflix called ""Kid Cosmic"" I could relate to Kid, all his pain, his moments of feeling unworthy, I just found someone/something to cry. I really like such series also like ""Gravity Falls"" always seeking the next adventure. I hadn't had a good childhood, I was getting bullied, mostly in primary school because of my low weight (to relate now I'm 187cm tall and I weigh 54 kilograms). I would never have any best friends nor close friends, just school friends who ditch you when they feel like it, they make you feel like garbage. And rn I do feel like garbage, I am always told how bad I am in my apprenticeship, I'm told what I can't do or what I must do. My Company keeps applying pressure on top of, they want me to ""just be good"", but honestly telling someone to just be good doesn't help. I hate work all of it, I hate small talk, I hate fake laughing every day just not to show how broken I am, I don't want my walls to go down.

I also share nihilistic & pessimistic traits. I hate to be born into a place where no matter my effort, succeeding is impossible – I live in a cage made by my ancestors. I just see the pain in people – But what I too see is, that their ok with it – They share the mentality: ""It is how it is""  and I can't cope with it. I feel like the purpose of existence is pain that leads to self-destruction.

Like IDK If I'm depressed, or if I just want to feel this way. I considered that I am, but.. well If I'd confront myself with being broken inside, wouldn't I feel worse.",2021-03-22 14:42:11

maij8v,"When I first started university last year, I felt hopeful. “This is the start to the rest of my life” I thought to myself. University, for me, was meant to be an opportunity to get out of the house, finally make friends and feel like I’m a part of something. Even before I started, I was desperate for some sort of human connection so this opportunity was like a blessing for me but then fucking COVID hit! Multiple students at my university got coronavirus, and now everything has to be done online. At first I thought “Well, it’s okay. I’m used to the whole studying online thing! At least I don’t have to do a 3 hour commute everyday.” That mentality is where I fucked up. 

At first, I embraced the whole situation, I woke up one minute before my tutorials started, and watched my lectures as I played video games. “This is fun!” I thought. But the novelty wore off quickly and I remembered my motivations behind going to university - to make friends and to add some variation to my life. If I had known that this was just going to be a continuation of the past 5 years of my lonely and boring life I would’ve never made the decision to go. I tried to make friends with some of the people in my ZOOM classes - most people don’t even try. I’m the only one making conversation and usually the only one with my camera and mic on (other than the teacher). I get it and understand. So, I stop trying to talk with my classmates and talk with my teacher instead but doing that isn’t enough because I know in the back of my mind that my teacher isn’t my friend and that she’s obligated to talk to me. So I stopped doing that too.

To take my mind off the loneliness I focus on taking notes, and doing my assignments. Periodically rewarding myself with video games for completing paragraphs or my revisions. The problem with this is that it’s *already* old. I’ve been doing this, *like this*, for the past 5 fucking years! I had to crawl myself out of a depression slump just to be able to go to university and now I’m thrown back into it. Every single day is exactly the same. The same four walls. The same bad feelings. It’s as if I’m a disembodied entity floating aimlessly in the void. Everything is merging into one and I can barely differentiate real memories from my dreams.

My grades started to slip, and I can’t handle seeing how low my grades are. I got into university with a scholarship due to my academic performance, and now I’m fucking failing. But I can’t handle studying anymore. I can’t think because I either stay awake for days on end or sleep for almost whole days and sometimes I forget to eat entirely. I started picking and ripping into my skin due to the fucking anxiety of knowing I’m skipping my classes. I’m at the point where I’m so far behind even if I started today to catch up I wouldn’t be able to.

I got my scholarship money today and it just reminded me how I’m a failure who can’t stick to anything. They’re paying me all this money for what? For me to sit around and do NOTHING? I’m sorry, but if university is going to be like this for another two more years then I think I need to drop out. I can’t handle this. I was doomed from the beginning. I don’t have whats required to succeed in an environment like this. I don’t have anyone to talk to let alone someone who I can talk to about my emotions. I’m far too restless to sit behind a fucking computer all day. And I’m STUDYING for a job that’ll possibly require me to do that even more. I’d rather be dead.

I already got the ball rolling on my university withdrawal. I contacted a psychologist, a job agency and everything, but that just puts me right back at square one. Again. I can’t help but feel like I’m a failure.

I don’t know why I’m even posting this. It’s better than screaming into the nothingness, I guess. Maybe you can get something from this.",2021-03-22 14:01:34
grsiq3i,"Hey, if you got into university with a scholarship, then you're pretty capable, don't give up just yet. 

Your professor might not be your friend, but she probably likes you and appreciates that you interact in class and keep your camera on, instead of just being a silent black screen. 

You mention you did this for the past five years, did you do online high school? 

Do you have friends? Like irl from school before, or online friends? Did you start talking with anyone from uni before the pandemic started? 

If you fear you'll have to sit behind a computer in your future job, is there the possibility of changing majors? 

I feel like maybe you should consider other options before deciding to leave uni. Again, if you got to uni with a scholarship, that's because you're capable. It really sucks that the pandemic and quarantine came right at the time you entered uni and you haven't been able to really interact with your classmates and make friends, but it won't be like this forever. Making friends in in-person classes is hard enough, in online classes I suppose it's much harder, but eventually we'll go back to in-person classes and there's a change you'll meet some cool people. Also in elective classes you'll be able to meet people different from your usual classmates, or in language classes. Don't give up yet.",2021-03-22 14:16:44
grsoyqh,"Thank you very much! I think I can be capable as well when my motivation and willpower isn’t sucked out of me. I think that maybe being an “academic,” per se, isn’t the life for me. I only chose to go to university because it was expected of me. I’m already on academic probation so it’s really hard for me to be motivated especially when I’m having second thoughts. 

I think she does too. I just feel as if I can be annoying and attention seeking. It’s probably a social anxiety thing, I know, but I can’t get over the worry of other people thinking I’m needy or something.

I did do high school online, yes, that and a few other qualifications. I used to love that I didn’t have interact with anyone but over the years I’ve changed my opinion. I feel as if online education is perpetuating an unhealthy lifestyle.

I did have friends, yes, but we grew apart over time. I never knew how to approach them after all of these years. It goes back to the social anxiety thing, I could reach out to them but then the thought comes in my mind where they 100% would have, by now, created a new life with new people. And here I am, going back to them after all of these years, as if I have never made any new friends. It makes me feel insecure. 

That’s the thing. I already changed majors. I’m not a fan of making the same mistake three times. I feel as if maybe this isn’t the right path for me. Maybe my subconscious is telling me through my emotions that I’m going in the wrong direction, and I need to go back to the crossroads to take the other path. Maybe not? I know you’re right, though, and I know it’ll get better eventually. It just doesn’t feel like it. My university has made no promises on a return to normal any time soon and that makes me feel really uneasy. I don’t think I can handle two more years where I’m constantly at home! It doesn’t help either that going outside has become incredibly nerve-wrecking for me. 

I just wish things were normal again. I take back all of the snide, ignorant thoughts I had about COVID when it first started. I was such an idiot!",2021-03-22 16:01:15

Now I am studying to go to uni all over again. Problem is education structure is so rigid here, so I basically am again a 12th year kid. (Maybe imagine U.S. med school students. When I was a kid, I had to get on the bus at 6:40 am. And for most others they left school at 10 pm. Some opted to stay until 11:30pm. I could go home at 6pm cuz I had proved myself to parents over the years that I can study at home just fine)


I miss working with lab equipments.



 Also there are other reasons that make me *have* to leave my country. Too many bad memories, among many others.


But reality is, I live off small stipends from parents who made me live by myself in a very small shitty room cuz I had severe social phobia and they dont like seeing unsuccessful children in their apartment.


How would you feel? At first I literally begged to let me stay with them, that my anxiety was not under my control. 


But nah they just don't like a failure of a person.


My sister works at a top company in NYC on a high position, brother is acing exams in univ. (Literally. 4.5/4.5 gpa. Ridiculous. I still am proud of him though)


Social phobia ruins everything, no matter how good my grades were in school. (Btw my college gpa is shit cuz you know group projects) No matter how hard I tried to be a 'good student'.

After two long years and a lot o tears and sweat, I finally won!!
Two years ago I sold this gorgeous horse that I had, I didn't want to but sold him as I had no money and had a kitten dumped on me (who was going to be put down) so I decided to find him a new home. After being extremely cautious with buyers and wanting only the best for him, he ended up with this family who swore the best for him. After 3days he had been poorly looked after and had gone through a fense, taking a lot of damage to himself. He was alright however, they then decided it was fair to cancel the cheque (that's y u don't do them) and forcefully dropped the horse back at my property. I then had to spend another month, getting him re ready but managed to find him a beautiful new home, at a cost to me. This cost to me that I endured is what I won today!!
They still have to actually pay it but it feels so good, not for the small $ value but more so moral. He was a good horse who didn't deserve to spend any time with them and they still, up until today, believed they were entirely in the right.

mai5d4,"Hello.
I would like to tell a (usually close) friend that she isn't very helpful and I feel very disappointed in the way she acts but I can not say it right to her face.
She does all the things like 

- telling me it's not that bad but she knows problems like that too/ ""oh but that's normal, don't make yourself crazy about this""

-  telling me she is sorry but I don't feel like she really cares. Maybe a bit overwhelmed herself but idk I feel like at her situation I would do my research on how to help instead of just reacting (wrong) when the sick person reaches out.

- not reaching out to me and if she does, it's quite superficial imo. E.g. breaking of a phone call and saying ""ill call u back later"" just to never call back or mention it again

I want to believe that it is just her being totally overwhelmed and not sensitized to mental health problems. And even though I am quite hurt about that she doesn't seem to research herself I would like to give it a try to send her an article or video with all the important basics on depression and what is helpful behavior/ whats not. If that doesn't work I will have to revalue that friendship but I am not quite ready and still hope it's just misunderstanding.

Do you have articles, videos or other  resources that could help me?",2021-03-22 13:32:26

I hope this helps a little!!!

Edit: this has also helped me a crap ton! I can't believe I forgot to mention this. But I recommend reading a book called Breath by James Nestor. It is crazy and sounds crazy. But fixing how you breathe and practicing different breathing techniques and using guided breath work can and will almost certainly be beneficial to anyone that does this. 

Also, I mentioned drinking water first thing in the morning because rehydration when you wake can give you ""clean energy"" and you'll feel more alert and alive... doing the little things can really help to set your day up for success.

I had no idea what I was missing until I took my health seriously enough to start medication. I remember that during my first week on the meds I was able to sit down with a friend and just relax. Really relax. Relax and feel content. It was amazing, and the best part is that little things like that happen all the time now!

grsfxd9,"It can be hard for some people to understand the extent to which mental illnesses affect those who have them. I think that you are doing wonderfully for taking the initiative to ask for help on this platform. I highly recommend getting professional help for your mental illness. To go about this, you could try asking to speak to your primary care physician alone the next time you have an appointment/checkup. Tell them about your mental health and your parents' unwillingness to get you the help they need. A good healthcare provider will take you very seriously and do everything they can to get you better. They care because they understand.

As for your self esteem, I'm truly sorry that your parents have failed you in this way. I think the best thing you can do for yourself is try to find some way (no matter how small) to try to build your esteem without thinking about how others (namely, your parents) judge you. This could be working on a new hobby, trying to start a new routine, or just brushing your teeth for 3 days in a row. You need to recognize the victories because you deserve to feel accomplished when you complete something challenging. Doing anything with depression is like doing it with one hand tied behind your back.

One final recommendation: If you can't get assistance from your primary care physician or you notice your health getting worse, call a local crisis hotline. You do not need to be suicidal or in immediate danger to call a hotline! They will help you at any stage of the battle against mental illness, including just not having anyone else to talk to about your struggles. They will also provide you with resources for getting professional care - all you have to do is ask and explain your situation. In fact, local crisis hotlines are so helpful that I would recommend calling one soon to ask their advice about getting treatment/therapy/counseling.",2021-03-22 13:28:12

mahpdw,"I’ll start by saying, there are probably people in a worse position as me. I don’t doubt that, but I sometimes feel like my own problems can be the end of the world.

I’m a 20 y/o male and i’m currently traveling California as an AF Medic. Right now i’m in San Francisco. (just a little background about me)

Anyways, the message in question is this one :

“i feel like we, or at least I, never got any closure. I’ve been having some weird dreams lately about us. it’s just really getting to me. It’s probably nothing. It was kinda weird cause I was having a bit of an off day, because of a dream I had last night. It felt so real. It felt like it wasn’t over. I’ve gone through it in my head a thousand times and I just can’t get my mind off it. I honestly can’t picture a world without you. I’ve been doing so much for myself and really just all around becoming better, but it always feels like that part of me that came out when I was with you has completely left me. I’m so alone and it never was like that, not until after I met you and we ended. I lacked experience. I lacked patience. and I lacked perseverance. You were like the first person I ever looked up to like legitimately. I swear at times I wanted to serve the world on a platter to you. And my brain has over-thunk it a bajillion times. All the situations where we were with each other and I’m constantly trying to figure out what I could’ve done to be better. It almost feels like ever since we broke up, i’ve been asking questions about myself I never thought I’d ask and now i’m faced with answers that I don’t particularly want and it’s leaving me empty. I know we were only together for what was honestly a short while, but it felt longer in my head. It felt like years, but it still never feels like it was enough time. I guess the universe is trying to communicate.”

The reason there is no greeting is because today she contacted me through snapchat when I posted a picture of myself on my story.

Besides everything I said, I feel extra down lately. I’ve been having like post traumatic relationship dreams and they feel so real. (We broke up a little over a year ago). We were together for about half a year, but it felt like may years. She was essentially everything I wanted in a person and to think at the time that she loved me back. (I like to believe she did and that if she didn’t she wouldn’t have told me it many times when we were together. I could be wrong, but it’s easier to hold onto, at the very least, that belief)

Lately, I’ve had a hell of a time trying to keep my mind off of her. I’d been off for a little while and I found myself falling back into old bad habits before I left to basic training. My heart just isn’t in anything that I do. I stopped writing (my dream to become a published novelist has pretty much completely halted due to this) and I have no motivation for anything. I get up in the morning only because the government wants me to and I refuse to give my superiors a reason to make my life harder. So, I just want to keep things relaxed within my work-life. It’s getting increasingly harder as the days pass though. My team constantly wants to hang out and though I can come off as extroverted at times, I’m a huge introvert. Working all day and then going to the gym or hanging out is just so draining to me. Yet, they persistently want me to spend time with them (I’m on a different team now than I was before due to a mission restructure). No I don’t hate them, or think they’re bad people, it’s honestly the opposite. I think they’re good folks, I just can’t bring myself around to connecting with anyone anymore. I try and fail over and over. It doesn’t even feel like my best friend really is my best friend anymore. I’ve been away for so long and now all I do is play games with him. Plus, he moves to georgia soon. I really don’t know how to cope with my grief from him leaving or how to tell him that It really is painful for me. I don’t want to dictate his decision in anyway as he’s my closest friend.

To sum it up, things in my life have been changing constantly since October of 2019, when I broke up with my Ex. (Yes, I broke up with her, it’s complicated, it wasn’t bad, more mutual than anything, but it was indeed complicated and I still feel like I have no closure)

I figured reddit may be a good place to vent my feelings and see if anyone feels similarly or has any kind of advice. All is welcome. I just miss being the happy kid that I knew myself to be back when I was far younger. I guess sometimes it comes with being a kid though, Once I started to comprehend, things just got relentlessly harder.

Thank you if you read this far.. I hope everyone is having a good night and if you’re not, I’m here if you’d like to chat. much love

mahndu,"I never understood what depression truly was before this pandemic. The lockdown in march 2020 introduced me to it after a month or so of living alone seeing nobody and it’s been present ever since (in our 3rd lockdown rn here in the uk) This led to a breakup with the girl who I thought was going to be wife and I still haven’t gotten over her and still deep down think once life is back to normal we will do everything we had planned pre Covid. Everything on the outside would appear great for me, 29 own a property have a decent amount of money have great friends etc but I feel empty. I some days even think about the best ways to commit suicide and who I would leave what to in my will.

mahe5h,"It has been like 8 months since I have had depression . Idk if it is bipolar or not . All I wanted since last year was therapy or any kind of professional mental help.

Depression has affected everything - my conscience, memory , mental peace, mood .. everything !                               I am in 10th grade and I feel that I am naturally unable to remember a lot of stuff or study for more than 2 hours a day. My heath is ruined and  I have not even gone out for a walk since months . I was really suicidal  but somehow I survived and promised myself that I will keep trying . My relations with my parents and friends were never good and these days it is getting even worse .

I wanted to gather courage to ask my parents to get me to a therapist after 2 months. After two months because I have a really important exam in around one and a half month and I have to study for it anyhow. I could not study anything since last year no matter how many routines  i made or how much I tried to focus. I am running out of time . If things keep going like this.. after the end of my semester , neither I will have good grades nor the will to do anything but die.

So recently I thought that telling my parents about it within a few days would be better bc then I will at least feel ok from therapy and if i get a little better within 15 days then maybe I will be able to focus on studies as well .

The problem is that I have lost trust in people . Idk why . I only have one kind friend on reddit and we try to hang on together to survive this.  My father does not even believe that teens can get depressed. My parents are so overprotective that they would start thinking that its because of them that I need therapy. It's a little true but not entirely true. I can't tell you how weird and full of misunderstanding , emotions and mentally demanding that talk with my parents would get. And I would prefer to talk to only one parent which would be my father

For once I am even ready to bear all that.

I really wanna know from you guys ... Should I talk to my parents after two months or within these two days ? And how exactly should I do that ?

Thank you for reading and take care of yourselves guys.",2021-03-22 12:39:28
mahd5n,"This is a very important decission to me.

Only people close to me know about my struggles. I'm a professional at the same time, I want to break stigma and misconceptions and I feel like I have a voice. Life has given me a voice. People don't ignore what I say.

I'd be disclosing I have severe recurring depression and BPD both with psychotic symptoms. I'll point out I'm a loving person, not agressive at all, my desire is to create conscience and break stigma. I'm a professional too in a highly competitive field. And I will try to explain both diagnosis in simple words.

Is this a bad idea? Opening up about my diagnosis to the people closest to me has actually considerably improved our relationship. I can confidently say I have best friends that love me as much as I love them.

Disclosing this is hard for me, I'm a guy nearing 27, where I live men aren't supposed to talk about their feelings, it's a sign of weakness. But I feel there's something I need to say. Maybe I could make a chance. **What are your thoughts?** I don't use my real name in social media. It's not like people can track me back to my professional life, only people close to me could do this. And I don't mind at all.

mahabs,"With the pandemic and all, 2020 was hands down the worst year of my life. And that misfortune is leaking into 2021. 

I’m surprised I’m still alive. I haven’t been able to do my favorite hobby in over one year now, something gives me a reason to live. I suppose what keeps me going is the possibility of doing it again one day, and the memories of the past when it made me so happy.

It’s gotten to the point that I’m over-fantasizing those memories. Not just my hobbies, but friendships and romantic partners. Man, what I would do to go back to 2017... the happiest fucking year of my life. Everything was in tune. I can’t believe how far down I’ve fell from there. 

But, I have been depressed since before 2017... so was it really as good as I remember? There were certainly many depressing times in 2017, but I remember it as an extremely happy time in my life. This makes me wonder if I’ll ever be truly happy. Or will I just keep remembering the past as happier than it actually was, and then hope to make new memories as happy as the old ones, while always discounting the present as unhappy. Does that even make sense? I need a fucking therapist. Not the virtual kind, the one where you go into their office. See, can’t even have that during the pandemic. How great is that?!

I miss my friends. I miss my ex. I miss hanging out with people. I miss going to eat with them, drinking boba with them, having fun with them. The pandemic has made me realize how much I took for granted. But it’s also absolutely destroyed mental health. Am I just weak? What the fuck is wrong with me? I need help. Fuck, I need so much help. I need to get away from here. I don’t like it here, I think I’m losing my mind. But where do I even go? Seriously, what’ll it change if I leave? I’ll still be depressed. DEPRESSED. These fucking meds I’ve been taking for FIVE YEARS. They just barely keep me from taking my own life. Not much else. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! What a terrible fucking way to live! 



I need a hug, I need comfort, please, I am begging you God, or whoever is the all-knowing sadistic being that is making me live through this suffering. Please, just give me a break. Please.",2021-03-22 12:31:51

grsk17c,Honestly its hard to give an answer when we aren't sure what caused all of this. But despite that never feel pressured to give away a part of your feelings you're not ready to share with people yet. Every day I feel like I wanna just become a tiny thing and than just disappear quietly. Now more so than ever lately. But my advice is exercise. It sounds silly but when you go there you kind of think since I came all this way here I might as well do something. And when you go consistently enough you tend to see the positive changes in life. If your just tired and don't feel like talking to humans anymore that's fine. I had a cat that helped me through the loneliness and even if I spent all my life in bed as long as he was with me I think I'd manage though that might not be financially wise. And if you're not sure why in general you feel apathetic maybe consult a doctor or nutritionalist. Anemia tends to have symptoms that line up with how you feel. You never know maybe your short on iron. But always talk to a doctor first. But lastly never be afraid to ask people to listen.

I wish I had friends I could be myself with. I lost any thing close to a friend that I had. I just want someone who I can be silly with that will laugh with me, but also someone who I can talk to about my feelings and get support from. I’ve never had a friend like that. 

I wish I wasn’t this boring person I pretend to be. I know I can be a fun person. I just don’t though. What would happen if I stopped focusing on school and just started focusing on happiness? What would my parents think? Would I be happier? Everyone else seems so happy. 

I wish I knew how to talk to people. Maybe if I wasn’t such a shy, insecure loser I would be able to have a friend. Even if I did get one would I even know what to say? What would I even do with them? Just hang?

grsbkrs,Honestly how a person is in high-school is nothing compared to outside of high-school.

And going to a college even a community College introduces you to all sorts of people you never thought would be your friend. Social barriers tend to matter much less than.

You can compliment someone, in literally anything, their shoes, their presentation, then either let it hang out there and that’s that to see how the respond, or you can just then say one thing about you like, oh I had shoes like that. Stick to just being chill, like hey that is really cool or something or other, fake it to you make it, just act fun or confident when you open your mouth again might seem impossible but go from the heart

You could just say, hey “name of person” how was your weekend? This works with people you’re attracted to also

Stuff like that, simple stuff, it’ll be good practice now even if it doesn’t go great you’ll be better in college if you choose to go to college

You need to get out of that situation.  

Your boyfriend is clearly unstable himself, or harbouring some deep insecurities that are making him act out this way.

And if he’s already manipulated your landlord into his way of thinking, then it’s just a matter of time before he plays that hand he’s been developing.    

Get out, pack your shit, the shit that actually means something to you, tell a friend/family member what’s been going on, and hopefully one of them will help you out.

You can’t be living under that kind of abuse of power.

Longest relationship I've had was 7 months. Everything after that has just been a couple of weeks here and there. These will happen every couple years with long droughts between. I've tried being aware of what loses people interest but I just can't find the winning ratio. I've talked to a therapist and he said that from what he can tell there's nothing wrong with me just they weren't the ones for me. Then why am I still alone? Why is everyone so quick to over look and move on from me? At what point do you gotta say ""maybe the Dr.s wrong, maybe it's not the world, maybe it's just you, it is after all the only common factor here"". I've tried tinder in the pasted and now recently bumble but all this has done is make me painfully aware how many single people there are and how they are not interested in what I'm offering. I've must have like hundreds of profiles not one match. I bought the thing that let's you see who likes your profile and I can strike a conversation with them for a day or 2, and then they leave. I even had one talk and act like they were having fun for nearly a week. I even started to think hey maybe we could go out and eat but before I asked she killed the convo.

magjdo,"For years I’ve been bullied and picked on for being a “mutant” that I’ve grown to enjoy letting others take credit, trying to blend in to not be noticed and overall avoiding being seen. Even my birthdays like today as I write this at 00:43, my best friend made me stay with her because she’s known my birthdays are the worst days for me with my suicidal thoughts and attempts, I’ve packed all my things and I’m laying in her bedroom doorway wanting to leave without being noticed and drive 6 hours out of the state until the days over, but my family tracks my phone and my best friend would be crying.

I don’t know what to do anymore, my one friend stays around just so I don’t end up left alone for too long and die, she acts like she’s not but I notice how annoyed she gets when I start messing around. That’s the benefit of hiding for the best part of 22 years, you learn human behaviors and understand it but can’t associate with the feelings.

All my past birthdays have ended alone, half the time it wasn’t just “friends” that didn’t show it was family too. I don’t know how many of my birthdays I was dropped off at the skating ring or main event as my parents went to winstar for hours. It’s shameful seeing the pity in the employees eyes as they come into the party room with refills to see your alone in the room with your cake in their fridge waiting for anyone to show.

I know I should be happy I at least have someone but I always feel like I’m a burden. I’ve been disowned once already for something I didn’t do and when my family heard how much I made they came back, my best friend threw pillows at me telling me to use one or she’d hit me if I complained in the morning. Nothing really hurts anymore, ya know the “man up” saying that we’re always told, I was told to “man up or I’ll beat you in the front yard”, I don’t know how long I’ve been trying to just save money and leave, it’s just natural now to not want things and to actually take my friend places on my birthdays, pay, and make sure she’s happy to get nothing in return. I’m scared of people because of how many times I’ve had rocks hurled at my head, threatened to be beaten for the way I look (I have a scary face and my voice is deep enough to make children cry, including my niece and nephews), and when I’ve try to help a girl out with math or something they scream r@#e.

I don’t expect or really want anyone to read or see this. Think I’m just ranting on my life since I’m practically mute with how much people allow me to talk. I mostly hope this gets buried in the feed of anyone who could see this.",2021-03-22 11:40:51

I have never been the person that doesn't have a start to a conversation to get some semblance of interaction out of someone. Even then, it is a rarity for it to last 3 minutes and more than 5 words in a sentence.

In all my relationships, it just feels like it is destined to be alone in this world at this point. It has warped me so much that I don't even know how to find a relationship and stick with it. 

I can't find friends who actively care about me and enjoy my company enough to even want to talk to me. I can't find a meaningful relationship and it just feels like I'm sitting at a beach where I can see out in the water of emotion and joy that I will never be able to access. 

I don't know what to do in my life anymore. I don't know how I will survive. I don't know how I can withstand my emotions. 

The only thing keeping me alive is my depression giving me the ability to feel indifferent about my problems. I want them to change and to be fixed. I want a stable, emotional life with friends and a lover. 

I don't want to be alone but I've been shattered like glass and had my pieces broken even further by an emotional hammer.

I latch onto any relationship I can get and it will eventually gets broken because the hammer swings on me yet again.

maggiq,"“You are ok, and you deserve to be happy,” I say to myself in the mirror daily before work, after swallowing a Wellbutrin chased by a lukewarm La Croix that distracts from how desperately I want a sugary soda. One of the ways I try to learn to love myself is to treat my body like it belongs to someone I love, so the least I can do is to avoid diabetes and maybe something deeper will click. 

However, the fact of the matter is that I need to make these efforts, much like constantly reflating a popped tire and hoping it will stay put long enough to get me to the next goal. Whether it’s romance, work, or hobbies, nothing seems to plug the hole long enough, because you know well as I do that that’s not what those things are for. Dependency on love and belonging is a horrible thing for someone who needs to internalize their own principles of strength, stoicism, and meaning. Easy to say, hard to live. Especially when you’re craving validation you don’t actually need, and words from a lover who rarely means them. 

Awareness and mindfulness of your disease and treatment is a funny place to wind up. You know perfectly well how you need to deal with the problems and maintain your mental health, as if the disease cares about logic or emotional maturity. So to you, I ask you to please tell yourself that you are ok, and that you deserve to be happy. Because it’s true. And if no one has told you yet today, know that as long as my neurotic whackadoodle mind is still pumping that you are understood and loved (in a strictly platonic sense, of course). I encourage anyone who is in that distortion to reach out to your doctor. I’m rooting for you.",2021-03-22 11:35:34

magdli,"I had a really shitty upbringing that really sweet me back. I spent my teens/early 20s battling severe social anxiety, agoraphobia, and depression with no help. I got into a shitty relationship with a man ten years older than me at 22 who later admitted to preventing me from doing things because he was worried I’d leave him behind.

After I broke up with him I began feeling so much better. I was working out, happy with my body, dressed up often and felt great. I was finally socializing and making friends. I had started college and had a great gpa. Then I meant my current bf and he sorta took over my life. I feel like every decision revolves around him, which sucks because he doesn’t know what he wants. I gained 35lbs and I’m having such a hard time losing it. My gpa dropped dramatically and I can’t seem to raise it. I also had to take a year off of school because we moved to a different city, only to come straight back before the pandemic because he refused to hold a job.

These last two years have gone so quick. I can’t believe I went from so happy and growing to this. The worst part is, I’m 27 and female. That’s past my expiration date in this society.  I’ve never had any friends and I don’t have a life. Only now I have no hope.",2021-03-22 11:30:24

The stress from the pandemic and other things in my life are just too much. I am starting to believe that the most emotionally mature and healthy thing to do would be to check into a hospital.

I do, however, have a couple of concerns. One being that I am a college student. What will happen in regards to my classes? I obviously can't keep up with my work from a ward. The other is that in a little over two weeks, I have my appointment to get my second covid-19 shot, and I absolutely do not want to miss that.

Your focus in the ward should solely be on you and your recovery.

Not sure about the vaccination appointment. Is there a way you could be added to like a list to be called from if there’s no-shows? You might be able to get one earlier that way? Or call and see if you can reschedule?

mag9xq,"Over the past year, I feel like my life has been spiraling downwards at an ever-increasing rate. I finally was able to put long standing issues behind me, but after I graduated high school, everything else just got so much worse in what seemed like such a short amount of time. Over the past year, I've been slowly getting more and more unhappy. Every time something bad happened only sped up the process. 

The thing that hurt me the most was my childhood dog passing away in August of last year. I don't really think I've been the same since it happened. My first semester of college started only a few days after, so I was also immediately thrown into a pit of stress and sadness that I haven't been able to climb out of. 

I was able to get through my first semester fine, but for some reason, I've had 0 motivation to do anything during my second semester. Even outside of school, I've had to force myself to do things I used to love to do, like play video games or find shows to watch. 

Because of my lack of motivation, I started to ignore my school work. I took all online classes this semester because the pandemic and I've hardly done any work for them. I've already had to drop 2 of my 5 classes to lighten my load, but I still feel so overwhelmed. It's a struggle to do anything because I keep feeling guilty about not getting work done while simultaneously not doing anything about it. I was also notified that if I don't pass my classes, my scholarship money will be lowered/removed and I'll owe more money than I can feasibly obtain before the deadline in April.

I was top 10 of my graduating class in high school, and now I'm failing with the only chance of passing being barely scraping by with a D. It makes me sick to my stomach.

Even though I'm 19, I don't have a car or a driver's license or a job, so there's no way I'll be able to make enough money to just be able to drop the rest of my classes. 

I'm scared. I don't know what I can do. I don't know why when faced with immense debt looming in, the only thing I allow myself to do is give up without a fight. 

I'm always up all night worrying about this and feeling guilty and being sad about it without doing anything. I haven't had a good night's sleep in months. Yesterday, I fell asleep at 7 am and woke up at 1:30 pm. 

I'm tired, I'm guilty, I'm sad, I'm stressed, and I'm overwhelmed. And I did it to myself. I just don't know what to do.",2021-03-22 11:24:04

mag7oy,"Currently in my life my mother has kidney failure. My dad isn't all to well either. Only living grandparents are in Hong Kong so I can't visit them. Grandmother's cancer recently has returned and spread aggressively throughout her body. Grandfather has had three strokes and is bed ridden. Due to covid my families small business has lost half its work force. And my cat I've had since I was 11 will be put down tomorrow. 

I don't really have any friends to talk to as the only person I was seeing regularly and treated like a best friend was putting me on the sideline something he does to everyone treating them like playthings. He's done it to me before and I couldn't stand it anymore. We were like brothers but I told him I hated how he treated me and other people and haven't really talked to any friends since 2019.

I've never been in a relationship but there was one girl I genuinely had feelings for. She was in a relationship already and I always thought to myself its not right to have feelings for someone whose already committed. And secondly what reason could she possibly ever love me. There seemed to be hints dropped here and there but ultimately we kind of stopped talking and drifted apart. About two years later she left her boyfriend and had a kid with someone else. Ironically her ex-boyfriend soon ended up dating my cousin. I live in hawaii like the ex and my cousin lives in California so explain to me the odds of that happening. The guy knows nothing about me and my cousin used to live here but only for a short while and while she's visited she hasn't lived in Hawaii for maybe 8 or more years. 

I've always been quiet and reserved. People often told me I was very well mannered and engaging. Sometimes even calling me smart and well spoken. My hobbies were always exercising. I gave up meat due to never personally feeling comfortable over eating living creatures. While I was never anything special my family does own a small business, a condo in Hong Kong, a condo in Hawaii, a 7 bedroom home in Hawaii, and there's been talks about purchasing another property possibly here or in Los Angeles. I'm 27 and live a very active life style and I've become very strong due to working out consistently for three years near daily. I'd say I'm okay looking to maybe not bad looking on some days. And every christmas I go out of my way to be charitable. Once I bought my friends vr sets for one year. And the following year I donated $640 to charities. While I consider my family to be well off I don't make that much money so that's a lot for me. And I currently own three cats all adult strays I befriended and adopted from the streets.

 I should be living a rather ideal life style compared to many. But I have no confidants in my life. I have this consistent tightness in my chest that feels like a small blackhole but also makes me want to vomit all the time. I have this hollowness thats made me more or less apathetic and lose near all interests in television and video games and every quiet moment in my life feels so intense. I've had a pain in my lower left side abdomen recently and have had this copper taste in my coughs for well over a year now. I'm scared of death but I secretly wish this meant I could just disappear. I feel like a failure all the time. I carry with me an indescribable and constant sadness. And yet I'll greet you at my work with a smile and ask you about your day.",2021-03-22 11:19:54

Dont even know what to do anymore and where to start i just slept most of the day these past few weeks and played some games cos im a useless piece of shit. Everytime i try to start on a missing requirement i just cant seem to do it and even the most menial tasks feel hard and daunting. Last week i even managed to finish a draft on a subject's pt and all i have to do left is to write it in paper and record myself presenting that shit and to this day i havent done that.

However, my family was very dysfunctional so  I was with the impression that I had to figure out my own life. But I never did, because I didn't what I was lacking, I didn't how to figure it out and I didn't know who to reach out to.

Mistake made by my older brother were passed down to each to each of us siblings because they had no proper guidance and since we never talk to each other, I never did learn anything which led us to making the same mistakes. The only people I talk to was my friend in school that was my age and we were stupid. And they had someone back at home to give them guidance. 

I'm 25 now, and I just realized all about this when my friends told me how they always had someone on their back supporting them, giving them guidance in life while growing up. All this years, I've been figuring life on my own and it angers me when I realized I had all the resources infront me to help me figure out my passions, my purpose of going to school, why I was feeling obligated to get a random job. I resigned from 3 jobs in the span of 2 years after graduating went back to my parents house because I didn't what's my purpose of doing all this. But I know now I would never get that answer from family nor my friends.

It depress me that I finally figure out what passionate about at such a late age where its financially impossible for me to achieve it. It depress me that I won't have that moment of saying something like ""Yeah, I'm glad that someone said that to me in the past or else I wouldn't be here"".

And I would think to myself, ""I'm never going to be like that."" Low and behold, some 20 years later, here I am. It's 1:23am where I am and I'm drunk, typing on Reddit. Being intoxicated at least puts me in somewhat of a better mood. Today was one of the worst days I had in terms of dealing with my depression. I mostly stayed in bed all day and fantasized about killing myself. But once I got some alcohol in me at felt a LITTLE better. I got up, did some laundry, edited some photos. All with the help of a little alcohol.




I feel like I'm following in the footsteps of relatives. My family are pretty much a bunch of horribly depressed alcoholics and addicts. There's no way I WASN'T going to become one. It's almost like a right of passage. Like there was an unseen countdown to the day I took my first sip. All I know is when my mind is clear, i'm wishing that it wasn't. When my mind is cloudy with whatever drink I've chosen to ingest, I'm wishing it could stay that way.



I find myself going to the local gas station earlier and earlier in the day. That can't be a good sign. I don't know. I just wanted to get this off my chest. Been on my mind for a while now.

Like why man? We are supposed to be friends like I get an occasional gaff is fine but when every ten minutes you have to try and pick at things I enjoy or do it sucks. 

To top it all off we were all opening up about mental health and that jazz and around people I trust opened up about my family history of mental health and drug addiction issues on both sides of it and immediately afterwards was told by him ""Well aren't both those things a choice?"" Like why man, why did you feel the need to say that. When my great grandpa and grandpa both committed suicide and my Dad, his brother, and both grandpa's had drug and alcohol issues did you feel the need to say that.

I feel such shame about cutting myself... I started around probably 14-15 years old and did it intermittently, but I stopped probably a year or two ago...

I relapsed and started again but the urge to cut is much stronger than it was as a teenager. And I’m so scared people are going to see my cuts. I don’t want my friends to see. I don’t want them to think I’m crazy or be burdened with the fact that I’m hurting myself. They have bigger things to worry about.  

I just want to self-harm badly... like I have the urge to. But I don’t want to because it hurts and I bleed and I feel shame and guilt... but it’s an outlet for me. I guess just like it’s a form of self punishment for me. Like you’ve been awful so this is what you deserve. Ugh. I just hate it. I can’t believe I started again. I hate myself so much.  

I lie to therapists and doctors and my mother and my sister and everyone about self harm. My sister and my doctor both noticed my cuts but I claimed I had a scratch from the dogs.

I am sad that after 7 months of searching for a new software job after being laid off, I am working at Mcdonald's. I haven't even told my parents I am working in customer service again because I don't want to feel shamed. I am still conflicted about my love for them because intentionally or not, they make me feel like I am never enough :( , I desperately believe I should value their opinions but I don't think I should.

I am still writing code on the side but it annoys me to no end that I have the skills to produce good work but without a degree, I am not even considered for the majority of jobs I am qualified for.

Currently, I am living away from both of them and trying to reflect on how they raised me and talk to them when I am ready and hope they are willing to acknowledge what I experienced.

This is also a weird time for me because I am about to go back to the state where my mom lives and stay at her house for my friend's wedding. I don't want to see her right now but I miss my cat and dog very much and will probably be the last time I have a chance to see my kitty as he's 16.

but no one ever talks about anger issues, my fight or flight gets triggered everyday, and i literally get irritated by every little thing, when i would be angry i would just let my mind talk and not show it through my emotions.

i had this time where i would punch the wall as a coping mechanism, letting out my anger on the wall. 

this anger would usually be usually towards myself, but some other times, others would do things that are normal, but it would make me angry for no reason. 

sometimes people simply talking would make me angry and the only thing that helps is blasting music while wearing headphones.

i feel bad because there are instances where i would just let anger take over me, i would be mad for no reason and i feel like i burden other people with it, my brother would always say ""why are you so sensitive"" or ""why do you get mad over the smallest things"" and sometimes it would make my heart sink because i do not mean it.

You're just taking your anger from something else out on them. That's what it sounds like anyway.

I don't know anyone whom's 'inherently' angry or low-tolerance to the point that they can't control their emotions. (Not counting children anyway and immature adults anyway)

&#x200B;

I know you're not looking for advice, but next time, ask yourself, does this really matter?

&#x200B;

What I'm angry about, does this really matter? If it does, then yeah, LET THAT ANGER OUT. In better ways than punching walls though, like pillows, pillows are softer.

&#x200B;

Swing your arms wildly in the air! The silly things, bring yourself back to reality.

&#x200B;

Reality is, there are things in life to be angry about, definitely. We should try not to express that anger on those underserving of it just because we need to express anger.

&#x200B;

Example, a driver A. is stuck behind driver B.   driver A. had a bad day and just want to get home, takes anger out on driver B. simply because driver B. is in proximity.

&#x200B;

The root of anger isn't driver B. it's the 'bad day' and whatever specific events happened.

&#x200B;

What's dangerous, is allowing all the nuance of life intensifying the anger from the 'bad day'.

&#x200B;

'cause in reality, driver B. is having an awesome day, driving home with kids, and now driver B. have some random person behind screaming and honking horn, driver B. now have to make sure the kids knows everything is fine and someone is just having a bad day and taking it out on them.

&#x200B;

because there's literally 20x other cars in front of driver B. and it's 'no ones fault' in particular why traffic is slow.

&#x200B;

bad days are no excuses for taking that anger out on anyone. but in least it's a reasonable explanation.

&#x200B;

if a person is just angry all the time and snap at very little things, slowly, others will stay away. ya don't want to be that person. and it's not anyone else fault for wanting to stay away, every time ya snap at them, it's something no one wants in life.",2021-03-22 10:56:42

I love the purity of their light, how they move in predictable ways, from west to east- it's the only thing that seems reliable to me anymore. Their movements are a function of acceleration and gravity, graceful arcs traced across billions of years, mathematically comprehendible, yet impossible to predict. Back on Earth, we fight and scheme and suffer and cry and then finally die, all for no particularly good reason, other than we were bored or horny or hungry or lonely or insecure.

When I consider that light takes millions of years to reach my eye, I get this horrible knot in my stomach- the certainty that I will never leave this world. I will never feel weightlessness of micro-gravity, nor the crushing delta-v of a rocket. I will never stand on the surface of another world or warm my skin in the infrared of another sun. I am trapped here, at the bottom of a gravity well, in this body I hate, in this life that I hate, with these people whom I despise and whom are increasingly beginning to despise me back. I'm trapped in this giant open grave, a heap of dead and half-dead naked bodies. And I am trapped-in-me- I can not change myself anymore than I can levitate myself into orbit. 

&#x200B;

And so sometimes, when I am standing on the porch in the night, I take a drag off my smoke, I close my eyes and just imagine:

&#x200B;

I feel my head and shoulders loosen, as my heels lift from the cold damp wood. I'm rising now- slowly at first, then faster. I look down and see my feet dangling above the roof of my house but it's getting smaller now, just a black square amongst the streetlights. There's no nausea and no vertigo, none of the fear you feel when you peer off a tall building. I see my neighborhood, then turning west, the city lights, and I think to myself that the big city doesn't look so big anymore. Now those lights are blurring from distinct pixels to glowing embers. I can see the horizon over the pacific ocean and a moment later, the flat horizon now has a curve. At my tremendous rate of speed, I ought to be setting the atmosphere on fire but I somehow cut through the air like a knife. My frail form ought to have been crushed by the acceleration upwards and buffeted by wind but instead, I'm weightless. I feel nothing and hear nothing. I'm accelerating without force, by some miraculous means. I have no idea how fast I am going, in what bearing I might be headed, nor how I will ever stop, but inside myself I feel a certainty that this is right, and that I am going somewhere \_better\_.

&#x200B;

That certainty becomes a light inside my chest, and strangely, it appears I no longer\_have\_ a chest. I can't find my feet, or my hands either, just a brilliant sparkling starlight. My dick is gone, I note, and that strikes me as funny. I would laugh at my past obsessions with sex, had I still a mouth. All the things that used to matter \_so much\_ simply don't seem that important anymore. Along with my physical form, many parts of my mind are falling away. My desire to hurt myself is gone but I also have no fingernails to bite. When I was still human, I harbored a secret desire for the approval of others, a desire I failed to conceal, but this too is now gone. My insecurities and fears and traumas all faded. Before, I had naive dreams I thought might make me whole, a laundry list of tawdry anxieties to appease. Suddenly, these ideals became so silly and childish. Not wrong, just short-sighted. The quirky behavior of an ape forced to wear clothes and write software. I see all the flaws in my past self, how simple they always were despite my own counterproductive efforts. How I hurt myself to make myself feel better. How I hurt other people to make myself feel better. My past self seems cute almost- A funny little animal playing a stupid silly game.

&#x200B;

By the time I exit the atmosphere, I am (was?) no longer a man but a beam of light and in a few minutes (relatively) I will leave (have left?) the Sol system forever. I'm confused at first, because my sense of time has been so radically expanded. I experience everything at once now because when you are moving at the speed of light, when you ARE light, you are moving at perfect speed. There's no anxiety or hesitation. There's not even a application of willpower- I simply go. I am going, faster and faster, faster than anything or anyone else, so fast I can't ever stop and have no interest in trying. I'm finally free of doubt, and uncertainty and gravity and mass. Nothing remains except a pure expression of freedom, a pure white light that propels me into the darkness.",2021-03-22 10:36:28

mafefv,"I have been struggling recently with the thoughts of growing up. I haven’t made any crazy life changing decisions but Ive made little ones that I feel add up and I guess I’m just scared that I’m making the wrong ones or leaving stuff behind unintentionally. I used to have a best friend when I was little that I used to run around my neighborhood with, used to run and play without a worry in the world. I started into my mid teens and high school and I just kept struggling one thing after another, I went through about 3 toxic relationships, my parents almost got divorced once or twice, my old dog passed and it just seemed to be getting worse. It got so bad that it messed with my sports that I really enjoyed I was captain of the football team and was even offered a local pro rugby position on the team and almost made it to a state championship for boxing, but I got so sidetracked by my depression that I began to not focus on those things and I decided my senior year to not play football or rugby and Covid closed boxing and I haven’t gone back. I now have a amazing girlfriend that I hope I can marry one day as we’ve talked about it and I’m very very close with her family and everything’s going perfect. My family is closer then before, it seems I got it good but I’m just confused bc I don’t feel I should be feeling like I should. I’m actually starting my own dog training business through a doggy daycare I work at, so I got it all going. I just keep getting scared of my decisions and overthinking and I just can’t get the anxious and depressed thoughts out of my head. I go to my girlfriend and she’s so amazing helping me through it but it still comes up when she’s not around. I just don’t know what is wrong and why I still feel like everything’s going wrong at times even know things are going well on paper. I don’t expect anyone to comment or respond bc I guess I used this as a emotion dump and i hope this makes others going through this not feel as alone. Thanks.",2021-03-22 10:29:49
grs5i1z,"It sounds like you may be afraid of things falling apart, because sometimes life does that.

If this is you, take the days slowly, we can never be sure when the next random Thursday that will throw our lives on hinge, but we can appreciate and smile more on the days when our lives goes right.

&#x200B;

Or perhaps it's missed-opportunities. In life, to me, there are no 'truly' missed opportunities in ways. If only given the 1, then that's just unlucky. But usually, in life, we have the chance to prepare for the next opportunity if we missed the previous.

&#x200B;

Or perhaps, you're unsatisfied, then you would need to ask yourself, why? What brought you satisfaction before? What have changed? If what you do in life is satisfying, like taking good care of pets well so their owners know they're in good care. Kudos, you have found very early something that you can do in the world that adds value to your own life and others.

&#x200B;

Or perhaps, growing pain, come around this age, also comes the time to understand that it isn't all play time anymore. Your childhood innocent is over, but being an adult is quite fun as well, if ya do it 'right' anyway.

&#x200B;

Take it slow, although if you do feel like something is wrong, I tend to think that's common.

&#x200B;

When people have bad experiences in their past, they know that bad experiences can happen again in the future. We can try to prevent them as much as we can, but we can't prevent all of them.

&#x200B;

Because of this understanding, when everything is going good, we fear that it all might stop the next day. And it very well could. but also, not.

Knowing this, it makes appreciating the good days a bit easier, but also super terrifying.

&#x200B;

But since you can't prevent all the danger of the world, just do your best to prevent the ones you can. and if you have specific fears in mind, slowly build up the strength and confident to face them.

&#x200B;

If you fear the unknown of life, take a breather, since we can't really do things about stuff we don't know.",2021-03-22 10:44:51

The surplus is called ""profit"", and it's Not Ours.

So yeah. Human necessities not only should be free: they essentially are, except for the heavily armed people who guard them and insist that you pay with your labour to earn your right to live (and some steady profit for people whom you shall never meet).

Reacting to the current state of the world with utter despair is not, in and of itself, pathological.

I feel it would be an easy way in to starting therapy sessions vs. in person where I may not feel comfortable being vulnerable. But I know that in person or at least live video sessions where you can’t escape being uncomfortable and discussing difficult thing provides much better therapy altogether. I tried to start betterhelp and didn’t like that you had to pay a whole month in advance, it seemed expensive. I signed up when I was feeling very low. I often make impulsive decisions then and usually regret them. I chatted once when with the person I matched up with but when I didn’t get a reply for a whole day, I got fed up and cancelled it and got a refund. I have now looked into TalkSpace and am interested in signing up, but I don’t trust myself to make good decisions like this. I found a good discount code so the pain of regretting paying the price to sign up would be less. But will I still be dissapppinted in just messaging as therapy?

Reading the wiki on this sub, one thing that sticks out to me is people with worse depression have low tolerance for disappointment. And I really find that to be true. It affects my life so much that it’s what brings me down the fastest. I don’t think there’s anything extra terrible that’s ever happened in my life compared to the average person in the US (white male). But when I get left out, feel affronted, get let down, etc. I feel I’ve been treated the worst and that I can’t escape it. When I’m feeling good, I realize how much love and good things I have around me, but I am always aware of the depression demon on my shoulder. It’s just waiting for that one little thing to slip up and then it likes to rub it in my face.

I have had cycles of depression and sadness mixed in with being a high achiever and very happy personality ever seen I was a teenager. And the last 5 years it got worse and last 2 probably even more so. I can recall so many awful memories going back years of very sad days and how I tried to cope with them and then was ashamed for feeling that way. And even last couple years, I burst into sadness on too many days of the month to count whenever I am alone.

The complicated part is, I have a family. A wife that knows I sometimes struggle but does not know how much. And I have a baby 1 year old that I am so afraid I am not raising them right when I’m feeling so low and that it will negatively affect them.

Way too long of a rant to continue, but I feel it’s past time for me to find a solid person to seek therapy with and really gain insight into my emotions/thoughts/behaviors and help find ways to live better. Please give me any insight or feedback you have. I will try talkspace and give it a shot. But I probably really would like to find someone in person though with covid rules in SoCal it may be hard.",2021-03-22 10:12:39
maf24v,I've never had any friends except for like 4 people up to the end of high school and now we don't meet up anymore since high school is over. My dad is expecting me to act like our spanish culture but it doesn't interest me since he has never been a role model. I have a hard time talking to people because I'm usually a loner. Most of the people around me are strangers my dad works with or family I don't hang around withthat I cant relate to at all. There was this one girl who im sure liked me in elementary but I was such a coward that the only time I tried talking to her was in high school when I asked her out but got denied. I guess I was a short term crush back then to her. 90 percent of my school life was me reading a book to avoid talking to people the rest was with those 4 friends who I dont see anymore. Even during elementary school all I did was play on the swing instead of play with other kids. Immediatly after graduating high school I went to college. Im in my second semester of college and am barely failing 2 classes because I think I went back to school to quickly instead of taking time off to relax or possibly because even there I don't talk to anyone which makes me do poorly in college work. Hearing about the state of the world in the news or reddit about people attacking eachother because of racism or the injustice in the government towards specific races makes me only see the bad side of people I don't know and I can't ever be happy so im either jealous or envious of the people who found a way to be comptempt with their lives unlike me. Im honestly feeling depressed because I haven't made a friend in so many months with any of the same interest so I came here because this seems to be the only place I can tell my thoughts outside of my own head for once in my life so if you read to the end thank you for taking the small amount of interest.,2021-03-22 10:09:13

I tell myself what's the point of doing all that when at the end of the day, the average woman in public will always choose the tall person over me. Not just because taller is more aesthetic, but because the tall person has a longer reach in a fight, and thus has air superiority, and subconsciously that is a turn-on for every women because of security and protection.

And knowing that, 
I can't accept the fact that I have to walk around in life always knowing that tall people can over dominate me and are just better.

I wish I could go back to before I ever got involved with her in any way because even 3 years later it continues to mess with my perception of love and my self esteem every single day of my life. I was madly in love with her and not only did she end up leaving me for someone else that is basically a much better version of me but she is almost unrecognizable to the person I once knew her as when I fell in love. I feel like I will never find someone like her again because even she herself isn't the person she used to be. Meanwhile she is with this guy who is everything I could have ever been and more. After falling in love with that person I used to know, I don't think I could ever feel the way I felt about her about anyone else. Even if someone did come along I don't know if I could mentally allow myself to feel that way again. I know there are ""plenty of fish in the sea"" and ""there are 7 billion people in this world"" but no one ever mentions how those phrases go both ways. No one that special is ever going to stay with a guy like me when there are plenty of other guys out there who are objectively better than me in every way, to force myself to think differently would be completely delusional. This was always going to happen. I miss the times where I could have shallow relationships and be happy living in the moment but now I cant think of anyone romantically or even sexually because that part of me is just dead now.

maefpv,"I moved back in with my parents August before the pandemic hit, took time off from working to have a mental health break, I told myself. Found a job a year later and loved it. Ended up having to quit that job because it was destroying what is left of my physicality. I've been in 3 car accidents and while I haven't broken a bone, it hasn't helped my joints any.  

Literally every single day something hurts, whether it's physical or mental pain, I don't get a break. Since I'm unemployed I can't afford any insurance, or to go see any sort of medical professional. It just keeps getting worse. I want to talk to a therapist about everything so I can stop self-therapizing, but that's unattainable. 

I want to develop my social skills but half the friends I once had don't want to talk to me, and I already feel like I inundate my current friends with enough meaningless bullshit as is. 

My dog, my cat, and the thought of my mom finding me is what's keeping me alive right now, but I just cannot see the point of more years of this life.

I never finished college, and now I can't afford to go back. What I was studying for isn't financially going to take care of me, even though it was work that I loved. So I feel like that was years of my life, wasted. I feel like I'm at rock bottom and I know the only way now is up, but somehow it just feels like I keep busting through the floor to find more rocks to dwell in. 

I just... I don't know what to do, and I'm tired. I've been tired now for a good four years or so now. I just don't feel good enough for anything.",2021-03-22 09:33:07
maeeyp,"Just as a preface this account is a throwaway because I don't feel comfortable knowing my friends saw this. Also, to be honest I have no clue how to start this and this post might be all over the place but I'm going to try my best. 

Because of the pandemic, I've had a lot more time to think and I think it has made me a bit depressed. I've been juggling so many thoughts and all of them just make me sink deeper into a feeling of being lost and confused. 

I'll start with my childhood and some underlying anxiety because I think this is where some of it stems. When I was a kid I had a roadmap to follow. My mom made my lunch, I always left for school at the same time, I got super extreme anxiety when my mom was late to pick me up. My catchphrase was literally ""Mommy you're gonna pick me up?"" because I was so nervous that she wouldn't. I took my shower at 5:30 pm exactly and when I couldn't because plans interfered I got terrible anxiety. My heart literally races before the smallest exam or quiz and the doctor can never take my blood pressure because it always spikes from nervousness when they do. Before a track meet one time my heart was literally beating through my chest so hard that my teammates could see it through my shirt. This is literally only the tip of the iceberg I really don't want to go on too long. 

Now that I'm 16 and I have so much more independence I feel lost and I have no clue what the fuck to do. I want someone to tell me to this, that, and then that. I want there to be a straightforward plan that is going to make me successful. I hate independence because there is so much time where I feel just alone. Everyone is just off doing something different and I just want to world to chill out for a second so I can stop someone. I feel like I'm in a world full of unresponsive robots where everyone is off running full speed and I'm stuck trying to catch one helplessly. I'm also at that time where people are trying to get into college and I'm just not ready for that. I want to go back to the times when everything was planned out for me and I didn't have to constantly stress about completing work for 4 AP classes.

Some (possibly helpful) Context: I should mention that I'm pretty shy and that could contribute to my feeling of isolation. There's a combination of life history and probably also some aspect of the relationship with my mom that contributes to this but I'm really not sure. I've also moved around a lot to about 4 different schools but I have 2 really close friends that I've had for about 3 years now. I've also had some relationship problems with them. 

There's so much more I could go into but I don't know how to word any of it without spending hours and I honestly need to sleep. This post has already gone to shit and I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm some crazy psycho because that's what it sounds like rereading this. Writing this out has actually been pretty therapeutic and maybe I just need to keep letting my thoughts out. I'd really appreciate anyone reading this to see if they could help figure out wtf is wrong with me or some sort of coping mechanism. Thanks.",2021-03-22 09:31:55
grs26ch,"There's nothing wrong with you, you're just going through growth.

and it is very very good you have typed all that out for yourself, express your fear, express your uncertainty, in least let yourself know, you're feeling something not very good.

you're young. you have a lot of time. but also, because you're young, you don't have a lot of experience with life yet.

uncertainty was something I dearth in my past too. the societal pressure to be a good student and to go to college and figure out how to be a productive member of society.

I realize you're close to graduating in a couple of year, and it can get way scarier.

hey. chin up. I know you're going through a lot. but it's a good life. A really really good life. Only when you perceive it that way though.

I actually did see a few therapist, but I was lucky, because my foster Mom was also a therapist and she helped me a lot.

You have a lot of time, don't feel like you need to figure anything out now, or even when you're 25. Even people in their 30s are still figuring out what to do, and even in their 40s they're having change of heart.

What does this mean? The 'dream life' of someone finishing school and college by 22 or 26 and knowing exactly what they will do for the rest of their life is extremely rare and shouldn't be compared to.

Chill youngster! Chill! Again, I know it sounds so rough right now, but your life sounds very blessed to have these crazy opportunity in the first place.

You still have a lot of time to figure it out, and you're not any worse or better because you haven't yet compared to your peer. If you earnestly asked your peer if they know what they want to do, they don't, they're also young and inexperience.

They may have more guidance, more precision, but the reality of being young is, you simply don't know enough about the world yet to make inform decisions about what you want to spend your lifestyle on.

When feel lost, for me, it's really nice to have comfort in friends. But wise friends are hard to come by, but they certainly do exist. If you're lucky, you'll have a supportive one.

I do remember having supportive friends in highschool, so I know it's possible, it's just so rare, because most kids are worry about status and superficial natures.

If you have family you can turn to in your time of fear, turn to them. We don't want our friends and family to worry, or perhaps know about how bad we're doing.

But at the same time, that support system is so good in times like this, and if they knew, they would want to help, they really do.

Especially your mom, from your angle, she likely isn't the 'perfect' mom, but in time, you'll likely realize she did her best for the most part as you grow older.

From your post, it sounds like your mom loves you enough, and it's likely she can support you emotionally through these rough time.

I mean, if you tell your mom you feel lost, perhaps she'd share a story about when she was lost and younger. etc.

but, in the least, don't give in too much to these fear. they aren't real. they are only real in your mind. with perspectives, you can shift those fear into something you can control.

you fear because you're uncertain. you're uncertain because you don't have enough information yet.

in the very least. look at this post. all these sentences, even if you don't read, at least know, I believe these every words and. sigh. I don't envy youngster these days, that's for sure.

So much existential crisis and angst. I'm unsure where the notion of ""you have to go to college to be successful"" came from, but it's just an unnecessary standard in life.

College doesn't make you successful, that's just a lie people say, college help me a bit, but mostly it just cost me a lot of cash even though I went to a community college which turned to a state college while I was there.

What made me successful, is truly perspective, the ability to handle and maintain my emotion. The ability to formulate my own truth and thoughts about the world without untrusted others bringing in the hammers.

What I'm saying is, these days, I would never teach the idea to a kid that college is important and that their success is measured from the grades they get in school.

GPA is useless when measuring a person, it is only 1 variable to the endless dimension of whom a person is.

Anyone whom value a person based on GPA or degree, is a short sited fool.

but since degrees have became the 'standard', it became the accepted standard for America.

&#x200B;

Create your own standards, because the reality is, someone else have determined them for you.

You say you're lost, but you're actually trapped in my thoughts.

If you want to find yourself, you have to create your own standards, create your own self, create who you are without others leading the way.

I know that can be scary, but others leading the way isn't always best. As said many time previously, college destroys more than it actually builds.

If someone is seriously about going to college, they need more than just 'uncertainty' or desire to be successful. Because college, in America, it's just a superstore.

It's expensive pass the point of reasoning, and the way 'books' cost so high and need new edition so often, yeah, everything you know is a lie sort of thing.

The world is complex, but don't feel lost. You just don't have the power to understand it yet. Neither do I, we each learn as the years go on, at no age do we all of a sudden 'have it all'.

Even your mom is still figuring things out.

I say good luck to you! if you read this far, I think in least, you're either more afraid now, or not. I hope not.

Because you do sound like you have a very very wonderful future. And although you feel awful now, I think you'll look back when you're older and think ""that wasn't so bad, but at the time it felt like the worse thing ever""

Depression an invisible chain
Or a rope around my neck made from strings of bad luck I couldn't abstain

Only person I trust is death indefinitely
She been my only lover no infidelity
Each day we grow closer I feel her embrace so incredibly

Surround yourself with the people that love and care about you that you love and care about. Even if that's just your mom. Make new friends if you need to.

Don't be afraid to take the time you need when you want to be alone, but don't just shut everyone else out.

Most importantly, don't let anybody else take advantage of you and bring you down, and don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm.

Even if you ignore all that and you find yourself down, lost and confused, you can still get back up.

It's gonna suck for a long time, but you will eventually figure out what's best for you and get through it.

It will come in waves of course, where it could be years later but the pain and grief feel like it just happened again. Make sure to focus on your mental health and the grief you feel.

grsk6y0,"My condolences, I truly mean that. I lost my mother at 19, father in 2011 and prior to that, ALL my grandparents, aunts and uncles. Sad to say, I know a thing or two about death. 

I offer you this advice:

If you feel things are becoming too much, PLEASE find someone to talk to. I chose a cognitive therapist so they wouldn't give me pills and numb me. Not sure what your financial situation is, but if it is tight, look into Jewish Family and Children's Services as they operate on a sliding scale. 

In my experience, people don't know how to respond/act/react with someone going through grief like this. I had to remind myself that people mean well but sometimes say the obligatory words in a situation like this. Be prepared to hear it over and over.

Take care of yourself and allow yourself to FULLY experience the emotions. Some days are easier than others however, I chose to remember the good memories and that helped. 

I hope in time, you and your family find peace. It took me 25 years to find peace losing my mother. That isn't necessary as I was just too angry to find closure/peace. I hope that doesn't happen to you.

Be well.",2021-03-22 14:42:23

From thinking about him the whole day it will decrease by time more and more in a few years u will only think about him once a day or maybe even less sounds kinda dumb that the only way to heal is to forget about him step by step but the good memories will always stay in your brain and will never go away just try to connect them with the joy u had with him and not the emotions u had when he died.

grso20h,"Vietnamese American here. If there is 2 things I feel we share in our culture, it's that Vietnamese people are resilient, and that we say ""I love you"" very indirectly.

We fight very hard to do our best and if we don't achieve results, work hard to bounce back or make what we can of it, usually very creatively. These midterms combined with this loss will be hard, but what comes after will still be rich with all different possibilities, opportunities, and understandings. This is hard but you are strong. You are allowed to be sad, to cry, and be confused. You will feel sometimes that you will be okay, those moments are true even when the feeling goes away.

Saying those words to your dad may seem harsh, but I feel it is a form of love we often see or share. You were observing and mentioning his habits, watching out for his sleep and his health in a way that may be hard to see or understand at first. I think he fell asleep knowing that you were looking out for him in big and small ways and passed peacefully knowing he had a caring amd loving child.

madugj,"Work has been hell for me, between bullying and belittling and lying amongst my coworkers. My boss does nothing and insists we work it out between ourselves. Our third in charge called a meeting that just ended up with a coworker (who even my boss didn't want to come back from her maternity leave) yelling at me. 

I complain to my assistant manager but there's not much she can do and reached a breaking point in my venting which resulted in her snapping at me and accusing me of stirring up drama. I am very honest and always tell her to let me know if she doesn't want me to complain and she never has but being accused of wanting the drama that sent me into horrible depressive episodes was just too much for me. I did nothing but stay in bed all day on Saturday any no amount of coercion could get me out of bed today. 

I feel like I'm trapped, I need my insurance to afford my antidepressants and xanax and everything else that keeps me alive so I can't just leave. I work with children and they are the light of my life and I'm afraid if I'm fired or I quit it would make things so much worse for me. I work amazingly with the kids, the children love me and it's only a few coworkers that are bad apples but after a confrontation on Friday following up with my assistant manager accusing me of wanting the drama for bringing it up to her when she'd had too much, I'm afraid to face tomorrow. I feel my mental health getting worse and worse and I'm afraid of what is going to happen this week. I don't blame her at all for snapping at me because she apologized and said she wished I could just stop worrying about it, though she knows of my illnesses and how impossible it is for me. 

I won't go into detail about the whole situation but multiple coworkers aware of the situations I've brought to attention so I know I'm not at fault. Or at least that's what they've told me, that I only speak the truth but what good is the truth if it gets nothing done? Plenty of people should have been fired for the way they treat the children because our facility has no cameras but they're still here and I worry for the kids. I don't want my mental health to get worse because I'm afraid of hurting myself or worse but there's so many factors that keep me from leaving.

madmtc,"hi all,
I’ve never written a post here but recently I’ve been struggling because I feel I don’t know people who think like me or who feel things as deeply as I do and it’s been super hard and lonely... 

I’m a college student but at home right now during the pandemic with my parents. We just moved to Florida less than a year ago and I don’t know anybody my age here so the only people I’ve interacted with are them and my grandpa and aunt for the past few months. My parents think it’s the greatest thing ever but I’ve been struggling. Thankfully I’m heading back to school soon but I’m nervous because even though I’m alone here, I worry I’ll feel the same over there because of my constant anxiety about my social life. 

Last semester I lived in an apartment with 3 girls, 2 of whom I considered close friends. I made them my everything, which i realize now was stupid because I didn’t understand boundaries and didn’t respect myself. I tried to become like them because I wanted to belong with them. At the end of the semester, one of my roommates let all her resentment toward me build until she exploded and basically told me I was terrible and messed up and implied our friendship was over. I kept trying to apologize but she was so fixated on her anger. I knew the damage had been done. After that I decided to move out because she made it clear she didn’t want to look at me let alone live amicably with me. I dealt with it as best I could but I still have nightmares about her and my roommates and just keep thinking of the things I did wrong or how I got in so deep with people I thought were my friends but never really loved me, at least not the way I wanted or hoped (which is also often also the downfall on my relationships) ...I know they aren’t bad people and that her anger doesn’t mean we didn’t have a good relationship for a bit, but all I can see now is how messed up everything got. It just sucks because I thought she’d be a lifelong friend, even though we were so different we were learning how to be good for each other. I guess not at the end, though. We never even had a fight before that one. 

Anyways... all of this has led me here, to my ensuing depression. I’ve been anxious, depressive and obsessive (obviously with fluctuations) for about 6 years and part of me can’t stop thinking that I’ll always end up like this—burned and broken and hating myself. It’s this wonderful toxic cycle. Some days I think I can get out of it, but then recently I see myself falling in and making a home in the darkness. It helps fuel my art and writing, too. 

I rarely meet people who truly understand or who want to hang out or who ask me how I’m doing, even though I love people and always want to be there and buy them gifts and make sure they aren’t feeling lonely or misunderstand. I know this doesn’t necessarily qualify as great friendship bc it’s different for everyone and expecting things of friends isn’t healthy. But still I just struggle to understand...Will I ever have the friends I dream of? Am I the only one with these expectations and fantasies? Why does my college seem devoid of artists and empaths? Will I be happy in a group of people, or always looking over my shoulder, never appreciating what I have? What even is a good friend?? 

If people don’t reach out or they hate texting and you never really FaceTime them (even though communication is important to you and you often do it first), how do you trust that they are your friend, that they think of you or care? 
How do you stop feeling so alone with every person you try to love? And how do you let go of them when it wasn’t right or they didn’t love you back? 

Thank you for listening. Hopefully this resonates with some people and isn’t triggering😅💜hang in there everyone.",2021-03-22 08:48:34

We raise awareness for mental illness but the stigma is still very real. Nothing about these ""bell lets talk"" days take away the darkness that comes with admitting you have depression. I have probably a handful of very close friends who know that I have depression. Telling my family was a struggle which went horribly wrong. So I get it. I get why people don't talk about it.

If your friend is really struggling then do try to keep at it. Even if he doesn't respond well, the fact you care probably does count for something. If you want some suggestions then I'd suggest contacting a professional service for some sort of advice, or maybe even getting sober and encouraging him to do the same - or if he's sober, getting him involved in non-weed activities.

mad97h,"Hi,

I don't want to get into too many details here, as I have written about this elsewhere. I fucked up. I was insecure that I hadn't dated anybody before so when I started liking someone that way I went overboard and gett waaayyy to pushy. She told me, on multiple separate occasions that she wasn't interested in dating. But I didn't listen. Instead I kept making the same fucking mistake and doing the yawn arm thing.  This continued for a little while until one evening I sat too close to her and did it. She then got up to get a drink and sat down in a different seat. I realized I had made her uncomfortable and left. I then texted her an apology.

Anyways, I know that was a fuck up. A major one. And she has every right to be angry with me. She has every right to hold a grudge. I'm not trying to pretend I did no wrong here. I am having a lot of trouble moving forwards.


Basically, here's my issue. I gave her unwanted attention and I put my arm on her shoulders. Those two, in combination, constitute sexual harassment. I find the idea of sexual harassment morally repulsive, yet I did it. I acted as a harasser and there is absolutely nothing I can do to change the fact that I did that. 

I have apologized and everything, but I know that the relationship there is broken and we likely can't be friends because she justifiably feels uncomfortable around me. That's not the reason I am writing this. I am writing this because I am genuinely horrified by what I became: a harasser. I deserve punishment.

So, I was thinking. What I could do is go to the university administration and tell them what I did and ask them to launch an investigation into me and my behavior as a harasser. I already have mark on my disciplinary record (nothing to do with harassment, it was me just forgetting to turn something in on time), so if I did this in all probability I will be kicked out of university. However, I may well deserve that. At the same time, I worry about dragging her through this investigation. If I did request one, she would likely have to relive an event that made her uncomfortable. I don't think it's fair of me to ask her to do that. But of course these could just be excuses my head is making up so I avoid punishment. I am basically talking about turning myself in.

Should I do that? I deserve some form of punishment. What I did was wrong, flat out. And I have become something I despise. I have made people uncomfortable, I have basically destroyed several friendships and relationships, and I have no one to blame but myself.

So why am I posting this here? Well I also have depression and self destructive tendencies as a result of shame and guilt associated with OCD. I will post this question in three communities, here, r/OCD, and r/Advice. I do not know how much of this comes from my OCD, how much of this comes from a genuine desire to do the right thing, and how much comes from my self destructive tendencies. Again, this could just be excuse making, I honestly do not know. All I know is what I did is wrong and that I deserve some form of punishment. What do you think?

Edit: to be clear I have been making sure to give the girl space since then. I have left her alone, and I have certainly stopped doing what I was doing. Not continuing.",2021-03-22 08:28:24
grrx2db,"I feel as if going to university administration and asking them to launch an investigation into you is a bit much, if not a lot much. Leave the decision to her, though I doubt it's even on her mind.
 
I get it, you messed up and you feel like you deserve punishment for it. But it sounds like an honest mistake, and it seems you're punishing yourself enough as is. Punishment isn't the same as atonement, and atonement isn't the same as punishment. Instead of continuing to punish yourself because you feel you deserve it, why not direct that towards doing good for others? Volunteer at a women's shelter, donate to a sexual assault advocacy group, a program that helps victims of sexual assault, etc. 

Sometimes in this state of mind, nothing will ever be punishment enough. Learning to be better also means learning to forgive yourself too.",2021-03-22 09:03:44
grruhns,"I think you might find people have different ideas on whether this constitutes sexual harassment or not. What's clear though is that you're feeling guilty for doing something wrong and it's probably fair to say that this guilt and desire to do better is an adequate consequence. Too many people wouldn't do that, so for what it's worth I think that's one positive.

The easy approach to stuff like this is no touching without some sort of explicit signal, preferably verbal. Learn from this, that's enough to ask I think. 

Also, yes... give her space and don't bug her about it. People can move on from things like this and still be friends, it just takes time to get out of that awkward space. Not saying this *will* happen in this instance of course. We all have to learn from our mistakes and unfortunately sometimes we stuff things up beyond repair. But you can 'repair' yourself.",2021-03-22 08:37:20
grruzso,"Yeah so I have implemented new personal rules for myself like that one as well as a bunch of others (like, if they say they don't want to date, don't kept pushing, stop trying to be pushy and get a relationship to happen if it happens it must be natural, it can't be planned) and I am really honestly trying to work on my insecurities cause that's what caused this whole mess in the first place 

I found an article that explicitly stated that an arm on the should constitutes harassment.

Her and her friend group do not like me or want me around. I was talking to one of the girls in that group the other day and she basically confirmed this. So I don't think what you described will happen. And that's ok, I messed up and she's is entirely in the right to feel uncomfortable around me. Like I'd prob feel the same in her shoes.

My cat is doing fine because my dad helps me with her stuff, but one of my fish has bad fin rot, another has started laying at the bottom all lethargically, and my stupid lazy ass won't change the fucking water more often.

I thought I was responsible enough, that I could handle having more to do, but clearly not. 

I was going to change the water in my one fish's tank a few minutes ago, but now I can't have the light on out there because my grandma sleeps in the living room. Instead I had a breakdown over the water not being the right temperature and my hair getting in my way. Literally the tiniest thing sets me off and it's exhausting.  I don't wanna live, I'm so tired.

I try really hard to always remember to feed the birds and get them fresh water but sometimes that's all I manage for even weeks at a time. I know I should be cleaning their cage, replacing my girls water, etc. But sometimes I just don't. Anytime my pets get scared of me or bite me I convince myself it's because I'm a horrible pet mom and dont deserve to be able to take care of them. At the end of the day having pets is something I chose and I desperately want them to be happy and healthy and show them I love them.

If you're anything like me and forgetting is a big characteristic of yours, I have been thinking of making a pet schedule specific to keeping them clean and happy and maintained... maybe the same idea will work for you? You're doing your best, try not to be too harsh on yourself. Know that somebody understands your pain as well.

My gecko mostly I have a hard time getting him to eat full meals, and he hasn't tamed down at all. At this rate I think he may end up stunted and never warm up to me. It just sucks because I always do my research before getting pets and still manage to give them suboptimal care.

maczk2,"Long story short, I am 29 years old and totally alone. No friends, no girlfriend, no job... Nothing.

My tendencies for isolation started out when I was a teenager. I started pushing people off. I hanged with the wrong crowd, the wrong type of people, mostly manipulative narcissists.

Why did I do that? I think because I hated myself. I had no self-esteem.

I was kind of a ""gifted"" child at school, but my family was really poor. We probably lived in the worst house in the entire city, in a neighborhood that looked really bad, although a mansion existed one block away. I think we were as poor as poor people can be without being homeless. There were moments when that nearly happened.

My father was abusive towards my mom. Mostly verbally and psychologically, but a few times physically as well. Although the physical violence did not happen very often, it totally destroyed me when it happened. Sometimes I was afraid he could kill her. 

I wanted me and my mom to leave the house, but there was no one to go to. No relative, nothing. My mom never found a job. I never understood why. I think she might have depression too. She never fought to get out of that situation. And through that weakness, she submitted not only herself but her son to live and grow through that hell.

As a teenager, I was a part of a class in middle school where I had no friends and was frequently bullied. Since I already had enough problems at home and had a low opinion of myself I mostly just allowed it to happen. I didn't talk about it with my parents back then, but I don't think it would've made a difference. 

I talked about it with my mom recently, and she kinda gaslighted me. Made me feel like it was my fault that it happened, and I should've said something. If I didn't say anything it was because my family life was already broken anyway. 

What was the point of bringing another burden to the top of the table? What was even the point of talking about that so many years now, since it's impossible to go back in time? My parents should have noticed it. They should have seen the signs. They should've been there for me when I needed them.

By the time I got into high school, the bullying kinda stopped and there were a few opportunities for happiness. Like girls trying to get close to me, sending signs of being interested and stuff like that. 

But I had developed a lot of intrapersonal problems. I believe that at this point I was already struggling with depression and crippling social anxiety, although I couldn't understand it back then. 

As a result, I started shutting everyone off. I acted in cold and arrogant ways because I was afraid of being hurt. Because I saw myself as unworthy. Because I never thought that I would be deserving or good enough for other people, so what was the point?

Throughout my teens and twenties, I shut off everyone that could have helped me find a bit of happiness. Now it seems to be too late to rebuild that kind of structure in my life. I am all alone.

I am not exactly a virgin, but I barely even have any sexual experience at all. I got addicted to porn because of my problems and once had a brain-induced erectile dysfunction because of it. I know it was because of the porn because that problem went away when I stopped watching. But unfortunately, I have relapsed, and now I am addicted once more.

Sometimes I have suicidal thoughts. I seem to have multiple mini-panic attacks on a daily basis that only last a few seconds. But they happen happens dozens of times.

I am unemployed and can't get help.

I am all alone.",2021-03-22 08:14:15

I was working on this with a women I have been interested in a long time, I got out on the back burner the one time i actually reached out and needed someone, didn’t get a response for two days and what i got was “it’s 70 degrees out and sunny take a breath”. That shit hurt and reminded me that I belong alone.

macxg7,"21M.  For years i've been trapped in a cycle of doing my best to help myself through depression only to again fall back into pushing loved ones away, self harming, and letting my body go to rot. Now it's all finally caught up to me. I always fall back in because i feel like i don't deserve happiness. I feel like everything is my fault and that i deserve to suffer. Whenever someone shows me even an ounce of kindness i start panicking and my mind says, ""no no stop. this doesn't make any sense i didn't earn this. I'm not good enough."" Thats when i start pushing away and most of the time i notice it all too late. These thoughts have plagued me my whole life. Even though i'm doing my best to take care of myself right now there's just one thing that makes me feel like i'll never get better. One physical reminder, and that reminder is my teeth. Years of neglect due to depression has damaged them so much that they hurt and appear transparent . I'm trying to brush my teeth twice a day literally forcing myself if i have to in order to brush them , but it's no good they still hurt.  And that's just how i feel, no matter what i do those thoughts keep eating me up inside. It drives me to self destruct so much that one day i fear it will push me to end my life.

Being in college at the moment, many seem ecstatic about the return of most of our classes to an in-person format in the fall because they'll be able to see their friends again and resume their vibrant social lives. 

This sucks so much to see because all it does is remind me of how lonely I've been for as long as I can remember. I had virtually no social life before the pandemic, so there's literally nothing to get back to once this is all over, and I'll have to deal with watching everyone else have fun while I sit alone.

macuzj," I was in high school before all the pandemic begin, but I was a sh*tty person, Used to victimized myself for everything, something go wrong in one of my relationships, it was entirely the fault of the other person, it can't be my fault, I felt social anxiety, it was my past social traumas fault not mine, I can't triumph, it was everyone else's fault, like why would be my own fault?

I was all the time depressed back in my classroom, I was sad all the time in my school, the only thing that makes me happy were two girl who were friends of mine, I like talking with they a lot, we share a lot of things in common, rock music, anime, that kind of things, I never had physical contact with anyone really, I used to hug them a lot, I really really love them like anyone before, above everything I love that they would ear me, I never consider that I have a friend or someone who ear my thoughts and my worries, my parents thought they ear me, but everything they do is ""oh, you are sad, but everyone has problems"" ""you shouldn't feel depressed"" or something like ""why you have low self-esteem, you are handsome"" they think they ear me, but no, they ear my thoughts, but they didn't try to understand me

My friends were reliable, they felt empathy for me, I only have real friends when I met them at the age of 16, I really appreciate them, they were like sisters to me

But then another boy begin to hang out with us more, and I felt so... Replaced, he was another depressed guy like me but he was cool and know how to play the bass, know more music than me, everyone thought he was cooler, he wasn't socially awkward, he knows more things than me, he knows how to talk with others and I don't, they begin to talk with him more, they begin to hang out with him more, and I felt like they don't care more about me, tbh why you would care about a depressive child like me?

And that's were the real problem begin, I wasn't feeling like I cared to them, I wanted to be loved, like him, one of the girls even begin to be more mean to me, I lost everything that I love for that piece of ____ 

And I begin to be a Douchebag to them, begin to tell everyone that they were bad people, it's hard to explain, but I felt so sh*tty, I say things I shouldn't say it, and obviously they get mad at me, and that's where they say they need to talk with me, and something on our friendship broke up

It's complicated to express what happen, but one of the girls realize she was a bit mean to me, and I think we are friends again, but I think I harm the other girl, she felt betrayed... I don't know maybe it was something bad what she made me but I was worst, I can't decide who she can really like, neither with who she want to pass time with it


But I f**king hate me, why I would harm who I love the most, the worst thing is that I never explain to her what I really felt

And... I don't know what to do... I don't know... I'm just confused, I don't want to tell anything...

It's just, I was a sh*tty person, I was a victimist, a depressive  douchebag, an idiot, a dumb jealous...

They were a lot of things I do wrong, funny enough the day when we talk was the day before all the pandemic, literally one day after we talk, we stop presencial classes and I stop seeing them, And the girl who is still disappointed at me... Idk sometimes we still talk like nothing happened, and sometimes she is super cold with me and say nothing will be like before, but I don't know she is so bipolar, sometimes she even came to my house once, and other times she doesn't want to know anything about me


And in the pandemic I have been improving in me, in the things I hate on me, I lose like 7kg or 15 pounds (I'm not fat really, but I want to be in good shape) I have been improving my mental health, I think I'm better than ever in my life, I stop fap, I've been studying japanese and german, perfecting my English (I'm hispanic) and I want to be a better person, I want to be the best... Not for me just for they

And I'm also in a diet, but sometimes I have anxiety attacks and being to eat a lot of junk food, and I don't know, I'm just afraid that she doesn't want to forgive me, that she isn't open to another opportunity

I would like to isolate myself for one year, and in one year talk again with them, in one year I want to sharpen my German and my English, be in better shape, stop my acne problem, draw better and read more books (she really loves books)

but what would happen if she don't want to see me again, am I losing my time, I would like to end it now, stop living and stop the pain and anxiety, but could you imagine if she is still my friend and I end it up like that...

It's just... I don't know, no one but me can't help me save myself, but I'm afraid if it's too late...


I don't know if I have something else to say, I hope someone read it, and if you do it... thank you a lot, maybe I just wanted to be hear... Thanks

macjga,"I'm a 30\[M\] who has always had severe anxiety issues and more recently started dealing with heavy depression. A quick backdrop to paint this post into perspective is that I was in a relationship/marriage for ten years that ended in late 2019. I jumped straight into another relationship shortly after with a friend who was supportive of me when I was going through my divorce. We dated for a year and a half and broke up in December 2020.

I know that it is still probably way too soon for me to be looking for someone else to be with. I'm a very co-dependent person and I enjoy having someone in my life that I can try and share my happiness with. With that in mind, I started using dating apps to try and look for people to meet and actually try ""dating"" for once. I'll be honest the entire experience has been a huge dumpster fire. 

I've probably matched with ten girls over the course of two months, half of which ghosted me after 1-3 days. The other half talked for about a week and after thinking everything was going great they just disappear. I grew increasingly frustrated with the entire experience and uninstalled these apps about a week and a half ago. The thing is, loneliness is a huge bitch, especially for me to deal with. I had a moment of weakness and reinstalled Bumble last Saturday. 

Last Sunday evening I was laying in bed swiping and found someone local that I knew from my high school days. I thought what the hell and swiped. We actually matched, started talking on Monday, had two great days of conversation on Tuesday and Wednesday and scheduled our first date on Thursday. I met her for dinner Thursday and we hung out afterwords and felt like we had the best time. We also hung out Friday and everything seemed great. This was the first time with these apps I felt like something was actually happening. Fast forward to yesterday things were different. She was unresponsive most of the day, left me on read and I'm scratching my head trying to figure out what is going on. She tells me this morning I didn't do anything wrong but she has her own things to figure out. This is especially troubling for me because everything seemed fine until it wasn't.

Before this seems like strictly a relationship/dating post meant for another subreddit, I am extremely depressed. After my marriage ended and I wasted an entire decade of my life trying and fighting tooth and nail to save it, it wasn't enough. My friend who I ended up dating really helped me through it and I was able to recover sort of fast because she seemed to care about me a lot. We also had problems because it was long distance and it didn't work out in the end. My close friends tell me to try and be happy with just myself, I shouldn't need anyone else to make me happy, and I understand that but there is something wrong with me. Having a companion gives me purpose, it actually makes me happy, and gives me a reason to get out of bed in the morning.

The constant pressure of life, bills, getting ghosted or straight up turned down is really taking its toll on me. Most days I try to find reasons to keep going, and the reasons are becoming less and less convincing. I don't know what I expect putting this super personal information on reddit, I just feel like I need someone to hear me. I understand how stupid all of this must sound, but I'm so fucking tired of the constant heartbreaks and feeling worthless to everyone. The girls I talk to tell me how sweet I am, that I make them smile, but being a ""good guy"" has so far got me absolutely no where in life. I'm a doormat of convenience at worst and an ego boost for people at best. I'm literally so fucking depressed that I don't want to commit suicide, but at the same time if I got hit by a car it wouldn't bother me.",2021-03-22 07:50:35

First I wanna say, I am truly at rock bottom. I am 23 years old, and I am lost. I know lots of you will say that's so young, and I understand, but I am really just not okay. In the last 3 months, what I thought was my life finally coming together, turned out to self destruct. In that time, I was diagnosed with a pretty serious health condition, my girlfriend of almost 2 years left me for another person, and my family as of today has moved across the country. Over the last 2 years ive developed a pretty bad gambling addiction, quitting and relapsing multiple times. Under my recent stress I have resorted to gambling and today I lost everything I have. I officially have nothing. I am lucky enough to have a very supportive family who loves me and would do anything for me, as well as great friends. But sometimes, as im sure some of you know, it doesn't feel like enough. I am on anti depressants, medicine for my condition, and I also take adderral unprescribed to help me focus on certain things as I feel I suffer from mild ADHD. I have had suicidal thoughts in the past but to be completely honest Ive never seriously considered it, that is until today. This isn't a cry for help, I understand what life has to offer. I understand how lucky I am, and I understand the only person in control of me is me. What holds me back from leaving this place is my family. The life my family has given me is more than I could ever ask for, and me leaving that would be so selfish. But today, I really just dont know what to say. I am so disappointed in myself that I truly want to leave this place. My heart is lost for my ex, who meant everything to me. I have no money, and I feel like I just cant get a grip. I just want to cry. and I will. No idea where life is going to take me but just wanted to talk to you guys.",2021-03-22 07:40:00

The grammar is going to be horrible in this. I’m not feeling well. 


I was hired at Target March 18, 2020. I was so excited for my future with the company. I went from making 200 a month at my old job to making 2,000. And I was so excited I felt like my life was going somewhere. I’m a college student and my mom doesn’t make much so I was happy I no longer had to rely on her for money. Fast forward to March this year. On inventory night at my job I had 2 panic attacks in one night. And my life had been on the down fall since then. My coworker who was previously in me had been spreading rumors in our friend group. He claimed I was a liar and a horrible person. He told anyone who would listen that I was insane. He was ruining my reputation and defaming my character. He kept telling pEople I was a liar and evil. But I couldn’t take him calling me a liar. 

On March 11th, I said I hated him so much and I wanted him to be hit by a bus. My other co worker told our boss I said that i wanted to kill the guy. I had mental break down and proceeded to buy razors and alcohol. I had plans of just cutting myself and going back to work. I needed to release the pain in my body. My co worker walked in on me because my Target was  cheap and we don’t have employee bathrooms. She saw me with the razors and told our boss. The boss called the police and I was taken to the hospital. I was in the hospital until March 15th. After I was released I called my job and asked them if I could come in for my shift later that day. the Hr manager told me to stay home and they’d pay me. I said ok. She asked me to come in on Thursday for a shift. Ready to resume my regular life I early went in. The Hr manager and Gm manager pulled me into the office before I could even clock in. They told me the guy felt threatened by me and thought I was a dangerous person. My managers told me they needed to investigate further and I needed to go back home. Welp on the March 18, I called in and asked if I could come into my shift. The Gm manager told me no and that I was going to be fired because I was already on a final warning. 

The guy who said he was “scared” of me is currently on a paid leave and transferring to another store back near his college and the girl he’s dating. The girl who said I wanted to kill the guy is still employed at the store. 

Flash forward to today. I applied for unemployment because I thought that’s you did when you got fired. I realized after applying  I won’t qualify for unemployment because I was at fault.
I’ve been applying for jobs with no emails back. Were the middle of panini and jobs are few and limited. My parents can’t support me financially. I’m 20 years old and I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’ve been contemplating cutting for days. I’m in so much mental anguish and I don’t know what to do. Currently I’m crying on my bathroom floor because I’m such an idiot and it’s my fault I’m about to be broke. It’s my fault I got let go and I can’t blame anyone else. But I just want to die. I’m scared and don’t know what to do. I’m trying my best to find a reason to keep going but I don’t know if I can.",2021-03-22 07:31:59

mac3qd,"Not looking for sympathy or anything. Just venting.

I'm genuinely so fucking tired. I'm tired of waking up and immediately feeling this thing weighing down on my shoulders. I just wanna wake up for once not wishing that I wasn't awake, or not wanting to go back to sleep. I have no energy to do anything, but I feel guilty and bad for wasting my days away just sleeping. There was a point in my life when I was, at the very least, contented, and I want that back. Having to struggle to stave off and fight this feeling every single day gets tiring, and I wanna give up already. I barely have any fight left in me. I'm not even suicidal and I don't wanna die, I just wanna stop thinking and feeling anything altogether. I need a break from existing and having to fight, even just for a while. But this isn't exactly something I can run away from. My brain isn't something I can just take out of my skull whenever I wanted. I wish I could. I don't wanna die, I just wanna stop existing.

I try to do the work. I eat, I play with my dogs, I meditate, talk to friends, dabble in my hobbies to distract myself. But those can only do so much. My mind still keeps going back. It's like a cloud that's hanging over my head that I can't shake off. And no matter how much I tell myself all the good and encouraging things to make myself feel better, ultimately I know that it's because I'm a fucking clown and a loser. Full stop. If I wasn't, I wouldn't be in this situation. I can sugarcoat it all I want with nice words and shit, but it's all just lies. Lying to myself gets tiring. What makes it even worse is that I have no valid reason to be feeling like this. I still have my parents and they're still together, I still have my siblings, we have enough money to live comfortably, I'm very sheltered and spoiled, I've never had to go through any hardships in life. All that, and I still feel like this. Biggest fucking clown and loser of the year award definitely goes to me. I dunno why I have to feel like this and be in this.

Has anybody come up with a life hack or cheat code out of this yet? I think what gives me comfort is the idea that maybe our universe is indeed just a simulation, and that when we die, we'll 'wake up' in a better situation or whatever. It's a silly thing to grasp on to, but I'm kinda desperate at this point.",2021-03-22 07:28:19

my ex and i were together for a very long time after he stopped loving me. it was miserable, i was so unhappy and in so much constant pain. we lived together and i absolutely knew he would rather be talking to, hanging out with, and dating anyone else in the entire word. i literally did everything you could possibly imagine to try to make him love me again, but nothing changed or worked. complimenting him, being there for him unfailingly, doing literally anything and everything he needed, treating him like absolute royalty.  

it was soul-crushing and heart-wrenching but absolutely nothing worked. and it sincerely made me question what was wrong with me, how i could try to do everything right and how i could love someone so much just for them to give up on me and stop caring about me.   

it truly is so painful and horrifying. it’s not your fault. sometimes relationships run their course and it’s so staggeringly sad when you’ve done everything in your power praying it won’t. it’s painful but if you’ve spoken to him and come to the conclusion that he has indeed stopped loving you, it might be best to reconsider the relationship. as you do deserve someone that loves you and devotes reciprocal effort to you.  

i completely understand how devastating and world-changing it is to exit a relationship you’ve been in for years. but there really comes a point where you have to contemplate the ill effects a partnership like this can have on your mental health, because you do deserve a relationship that is full of love and reassurance. reddit has a lot of good resources like the breakups sub and exnocontact sub.

Besides... Realize that you just posted asking for help. That means that there have to have a precious pieces of hope in you that scream for help.

Remember... You're marvelous, you just need to endure the void to one day finally see the rainbow of happiness.

Never give up on yourself because without hope we are all empty husks that the blanket of void wants us to think we are.

Prove it otherwise and seek help, act, seize control over your life... And while that struggle is being done by you, you might suddenly realize that you love yourself.

But if you come from a troubled home, or you have had things done to you like abuse, physical or mental i cant say that Meds wont help you. I cant begin to understand childhood trauma.

Diagnoses are still a shot in the dark. Theres no blood test, no scans or xrays that can detect it. 
Some people have dips in their mood, sometimes that dip can last months. 
I do think I experienced my first bout of depression when I was in grade 6. It lasted for the summer but I was fine by the start of the school year. I was very homesick and thats what caused the depression. 
Then i was fine until 23– went to the doctors to get help because i couldnt sleep and was stressed. Put me on an SSRI(sertraline) which didnt really do anything but when I came off of the medication I began having panic attacks and severe depression. Now 5 years later I can barely keep a job, and im still depressed. Had to go on a different medication to treat the panic attacks but that killed my libido and made me a zombie.

I want to have people I have maintained friendships with along the various eras of my life, instead of constantly losing anyone and everyone who gets a glimpse of who I am. 

I want to have parents or anyone I can lean on that doesn’t feel like I’m taking advantage of them because I just never had a healthy relationship with the people who raised me.

I want to know who my blood family is, hopefully they are nice, but there is probably a good reason I don’t know who they are by now.

I want to know what its like to remember my past and be able to talk about it with people instead of sitting in silence because I can never relate.

I wish I had people around me who loved me then so I wouldn’t be as broken now. 

I wish that I wasn’t forced into the roles I was.

I wish I never saw a soul slip past someone’s breath.

I wish that I understood how horrible the sexual abuse I went through was, instead of learning at the age of 21 that my entire perception of sex is distorted with traumas.

I wish I was a healthy person to be around.

I wish I could just be myself around people.

I wish that I could live a simpler life, but the stagnancy leads to actually having to dive into my traumas.

Ive been trying to do that for over a year and all I get from it is more sadness. 

Today I realized that the only way I can get through this is if I accept that I just live a life of sorrow.  Somehow this numbness is more refreshing than the feelings that I longed for, for so long. 

So I go back to the shitty coping mechanisms that are supposed to make me feel better. Ill get up every day as early as I can, fill the day with the mundane and pretend that I haven’t already lost the game of life. I will live the lie of this life and be a functional cog in the system.

The world is a terrible place, but would it have any more meaning if we lived in a utopia where we wouldn't have to work or try? For some people that is reality, and some of them are still depressed despite that.

maashs,"In general i would describe myself as quite superficial and lacking in my life. Honestly, I can't connect to others, never mind therapists.

I have noticed that when i attempt to really talk about my emotions with anyone, my brain just shuts down and i have become so adapted to it that i have become defensive in increasingly convincing ways so i get left alone. In the past i have made progress with my old therapist, but there was always a mental block and i could never actually describe how i felt and never got anywhere close to ever really talking anything out. I think that deep down, i just couldn't trust them no matter how hard i tried. 

It's like when i try to think of anything negative, my brain just stops its self from thinking about it and i'm ""fine"", even when it comes to serious things that i should feel upset about, i just convince myself that everything is okay. Part of me thinks that i should process everything but i'm just totally unable to. 

I've tried thinking to myself that this is just the way my brain works and that the world around me is wrong for saying that i SHOULD feel X or Y way in response to things. I just feel like i must be doing something wrong and maybe i should emotionally react to things, because although i'd describe myself as doing fine, ultimately my life is empty and i'm very unfulfilled. I don't cry or laugh at anything and my friends would describe me as ""blunt"" in my tone and behaviour. In the past i have just stopped socializing at all and i wish i could say that i felt any different, but ultimately, i didn't feel any different.

Even when i was living with a pretty abusive flatmate who threatened everyone, broke everything etc. I was just so apathetic that i kind of just got used to it. I just went to work and came back day after day and just sort of got used to it. Eventually, he got evicted but i didn't really feel anything change. I was still just sort of living through a window, watching myself do things. I was still just holding myself together.

I'm just not sure what to do anymore. I just want to be functional and fit in with people, but contact with people feels quite meaningless for the most part and i have sort of just gotten used to dealing with everything alone. I'm just not sure if it's sustainable. I'm quite sceptical of therapists though, i had to attend therapy in childhood and all i ever remember them doing is them basically giving information i said in confidence to my school and family behind my back. I don't know if i can ever really trust a therapist to keep what i say confidential after that. 

I decided to go with the antidepressant route rather than attending therapy. I'm on Remeron, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything. I don't feel comfortable with extended contact with therapists and generally end up just missing appointments until they give up- i know i'm not exactly helping myself. 

Ultimately, i just feel like i need to move past this apathy and emotional bluntness to figure out my direction in life because right now, i just have no idea what i want in any area of life and i'm just so dull al the time that it's making life feel next to impossible. I want to feel close to people, rather that just being some shallow imitation of who i used to be. When i look at myself, i'm not even sure how i feel anymore.

I apologize for the rant. Honestly, i was just sort of processing everything as best i could and putting it into words, unfortunately it ended up turning into a boring essay lol. I have to admit that i'm a bit scatter-brained, so sorry if it doesn't exactly sound coherent.

I asked them every step of the way if they truly did care, if it truly was real, and they gave me reassurances at every step of the way and I believed them at every step of the way and I opened up more and more and let myself be more and more vulnerable.

4 weeks and 4 days since she said that she wanted a ""break."" I know that she doesn't mean a break in a temporal sense. They're bored of me. They're done with me. They're putting me back on the shelf.

We haven't said a word to each other for 4 weeks and 4 days. It feels like I don't even exist. I let myself be vulnerable to her and she hurt me. Love is giving someone the power to hurt you and trusting that they won't. Here I am, hurt, abandoned. She left me like everyone does.

I'm trying so hard not to close off from the world, but I'm slipping into old vices, old escapes, and old outlets again. I'm trying to hold on, I'm trying to heal, but the pain has gotten worse every day instead of better. Why did she leave me? Why did she hurt me?

ma9pwm,"I've been lurking for a long time and I didn't even want to join this sub just to keep the word out of my sight but guys, I gotta say it's getting darker than ever before. Especially in the last two years everything just goes downhill. I was a gifted child. Straight A's in high school, got into the Physics department of the best university in my country. Grades started to taking hits. I missed classes. I didn't leave my bed. In my sophomore year, I realized something was wrong. The life I've been living, what I assumed a normal life, was way below normal. I never cared so much about other people's life before so I had no idea that I was just used to my sad life. I always thought this was what others go through too. Oh boy, couldn't be so wrong. Before graduation, I was a mess. No social life, no relationships, no happiness, no reason to leave the bed. I didn't want to admit I was depressed because my parents taught me that depression was and still is just a way to get attention. 

For the first time in my life, I went to a psychiatrist. I took the depression test and her reaction when she saw the results was ""Oh my god... ""  It was then I got diagnosed with severe depression. However, I didn't care much about it because I've been living like this for a few years and I could just go on. Well...I couldn't. There were nights I really wished not to see the morning. I planned to kill myself so many times but don't worry I got a cat. I can't leave him behind so no suicide. 

Anyway, I graduated and started my Master's. My depression got worse over time. I barely passed my classes.  That gifted child was gone. I felt like an idiot (still do). I somehow got a job in one of the top companies here but I quit. Because If I continued I wouldn't be able to continue my Master's. The real reason is, the school was my safe zone. I just wanted to run back there. 

I went to a psychiatrist again. This time I was determined to do something about it. Took my pills, started a diet, bought a guitar, and practiced every day. Even started to go to the gym. Unfortunately, my salary was so low that first I had to stop going to the gym then I wasn't even able to see my psychiatrist regularly this resulted in not getting my pills too. For a while, thanks to the Cymbalta, things seemed normal but that didn't last long.

Now here I am, getting paid way below the minimum wage. I can barely pay my bills. I go to school every day just to sit in the lab and think about how useless I am, watching others go further, watching people who didn't even know the P in Physics publishing papers, going abroad to study while I can't even write down the title of my nonexistent thesis project. My advisor just tolerates me at this point. He doesn't have any expectations. He knows I won't be able to finish my Master's and I will be fired. 

I've applied to the schools for Ph.D. in the U.S. but let's be honest. Who would accept someone like me. No papers, no thesis, nothing. Well...they didn't. I've spent all the money I've saved so far for admissions. Even more than that and now I'm in a debt that I cannot pay.

I've failed my parents, I've failed my friends, I've failed myself...

Whenever I hear the stories of success from my friends, I just get angry and sad. I get angry with myself. I get jealous. I want to be happy for them but I can't. I'm turning into someone I don't want to be. I feel like I'm losing it. I can't see an escape. I'm going down. I'm losing this battle.

I'm sorry for taking your time with this wall of text which doesn't tell anything. This is the first time I'm talking about the stuff I'm going through. I try my best to keep it all from my parents and my friends. I'm sorry if all these don't make sense. I just wanted to talk. There are probably tons of things I forgot to tell and so many holes in this piece of writing.

Thank you and take care.",2021-03-22 05:29:45

ma9m1d,"I promise you, I'm not trying to be attention seeking here or trying to get you feel sorry for me. I'm just feeling super depressed right now and want to express myself and get this out of my system, that's all.

I see nearly everyone around me, both family and friends, that's around my age and they're all super accomplished, talented, smart, knowledgeable, and sociable. They all have great paying full time jobs in the fields they love. They all have their own apartments, condos, and some of them even have their own houses. They all have romantic partners and friends that they keep in touch with daily and even hang out with. They're all super accomplished with great experiences, awards, and stuff to show off and be proud of. 

And I have none of these things. I'm just the most boring 27 year old man in existence it feels like. I have not accomplished a single god damn thing of significance in my life and I have no awards. Okay, maybe I can play guitar pretty well and maybe I'm an okay at best graphic designer, but I wouldn't really call myself ""talented"" or ""skilled"". I'm not really smart or knowledgeable in anything, and I pretty much have the social skills of a boiled potato, making simple conversation incredibly difficult for me because of how awkward I am. I also have very little money and still live with my parents. I only work part-time at a boring ass job and have only have summer job experience and part-time job experience, none of which is in my desired field of graphic design. I have very few friends left and I don't even talk to them anymore. And I'm sure they never really considered me a good friend, I know they have closer friends than me and I'm more of a background character in their lives. I also never had a girlfriend before. And I'm sure it's because they see how fucking ugly and worthless I am. Literally, my entire boring ass life now just consists of me going to work and then coming home and watching TV, that's it. I've lost interest in all my hobbies and I don't talk or do anything fun or exciting with family or friends, or at all for that matter. And my depression has pretty much killed my motivation to do something about it to change things and make my life better. I have fucking nothing to be proud of and I hate myself for it.

I feel like everyone around me knows how big of a fucking worthless failure I am and I feel like I'm being judged for it. I don't feel like I'm loved or accepted by anyone because of all my shortcomings that I listed above. I feel like they're nice to me in person but, behind my back, they're judging me and telling everyone how much of a loser I am. I know no one wants to have conversations with me because of how awkward, unknowledgeable, and inexperienced I am in life. It all just makes me wonder, why do accomplished and successful people have to treat people like me like shit? Why do we as a society just accept this? Shouldn't everyone be loved and accepted for who they are as a person and how they treat people and not be unloved and unaccepted because of their status in life? That's just the way it seems to me and it's complete bullshit. Seriously, I just wish people would stop judging each other based on their status in life and spread love and acceptance to everyone. Maybe I'm some sort of hippie or idealist or something for saying that, but I just wish people would genuinely kind and accepting of each other, that's all.",2021-03-22 05:23:59
grri510,">Shouldn't everyone be loved and accepted for who they are as a person and how they treat people and not be unloved and unaccepted because of their status in life?

This. Despite all that's said about the journey being more important than the outcome, only results are celebrated in life. You don't ever see anyone make a name for themselves based on the effort they put in unless they succeed in the first place.

I don't know if I can give much advice, but 1 year ago I was in a really tough spot. Just came out of a relationship where I thought I did everything right, had a part-time job where they didn't want me anymore, and feeling directionless in my studies. It really destroyed my confidence and self-esteem. I wasn't motivated to change because I felt that it was all going to be hopeless.

One day I just realised, ""You know what? No. I don't want to spend the rest of my life drifting like this. I don't care if my efforts don't lead to results anymore. It's still better than doing nothing."" That mentality of people only caring for accomplishments can be really toxic and hold you back—it seeps into everything and you also think that way unconsciously. What I said to myself is that I have no guarantee that I'll succeed, but I can sure as hell guarantee that I'm going to try.

So, make yourself a goal. Find something to chase after. Don't be too caught up on whether you can or can't make it. Think about whether or not you want to try. That's how I was able to regain control and find some drive for what I'm doing now. It's still tough, but I don't feel so dead every day, and that's something.

Happy to talk more about my experiences.",2021-03-22 06:46:49

grshztr,"Yeah, I don't think some of us are really cut out for this. I don't know. Society is sort of a box nowadays that you need to fit in. If you don't for whatever reason, (depression, antisocial, super introverted, ugly, etc.) then you are probably going to have a pretty bad time.

Humans are social pack animals that almost require a group to function. Sure, some people are okay totally on their own, but those people are extreme outliers imo. Almost everyone wants companionship in the form of friends or a significant other. When problems arise that bar you from achieving that or cause major difficulties, it's a feedback loop that gets worse and worse.

I don't have the answer for you. I just stick around because I hope it gets better and I'd feel guilty going the other route, for now at least. This place sucks and I don't really want to be here, though. I don't know what my issue is, but it's been tough for me pretty much my entire life. Even though I've made positive changes in the form of being educated, fit, taking care of myself and so on, the situation hasn't really changed and my outlook has gotten worse. I think I was almost happier before because I wasn't so jaded.

grriwio,"Hei, I could understand that you feel in this way. It's okay that you feel this way in this period of time. Just feel what you feel during this period of time, your feeling is valid and don't suppress it. If you want to cry, scream, do it. 

Life isn't a race, neither competition. It simply unfair if you compare your life and achievement towards other's, because every one journey is different and unique in itself, every one has their own path and timeline. 

Assumptions isn't always true. I cannot say much about your feeling of unworthy of love and acceptance. I do not know what's stem behind of it, you know yourself better than I do. Perhaps, If it's possible to look back and getting to know about where all of these feeling come from, it could help how to overcome it. Like for example if you have some unresolved issues or trauma or experienced of rejection in early time, the key to overcome is to acknowledge your feeling and self healing that can be done with the help from professional. 

Not all succesfull people will treat you like shit, the way people treat other could be because of they project their unresolved issue. The most taboo thing in our culture or society is radical honesty, and thats exqctly the problem. It would take centuries to rebuild society system. As it is out of our control. 

I just want to remind you that people come and go in life, right people will stay. You are worthy of love and acceptance. The love that we need most is not love from parent or partner, though it feels amazing. The love that we need first and foremost is our own, love yourself.

I always hoped that as I got older, things will get better. It’s like when you take a hit to the gut, you just want to curl up and wait for the pain to go before you start moving again. One day I just realised that won’t happen. If I do nothing and wait for it to subside, it won’t. I’m going to be left behind as people continue with their lives without me. In the end, I’ll be left with nothing.

I saw the bleak future ahead if I didn’t get up and push onwards. It’s true—even if I try my best I might still fail. But I knew then that if I didn’t try, I’d fail for certain. That kind of future—the last thing I want is that. My motivation comes out of a place of fear. I don’t want to fail. I don’t want for everything I’ve done up till now to be for nothing. Not healthy maybe, but I doubt I have better at the moment.

I had no friends in highschool. I used to skip lunch and sit in a low-traffic hallway and just listen to music. There was an old friend that would sometimes pass through that hallway and I was embarrassed for them to see me. So I started hiding in the bathroom during my lunch period like in a TV show or something. But that felt too awkward after a week so I just started sitting in the hallway again. 

My rationale was ""ill start over in college"". Well,  college came and I was even worse. Now I could hide in my dorm room all day. My social skills regressed further. I have 7 roommates in my dorm, some have single rooms and some have doubles. We have a shared living room. If people were having fun in the living room I would pee in a cup and then sneak out in the middle of the night to dump it in the toilet. That's how bad my anxiety is. I don't have friends, don't talk to no one, and don't get along with family.

ma9io7,"The last year has been anything but easy for most people.

I've been dealing with depression for a very long time. In the last year, I've cycled through a couple of ups and downs. Because I'm working from home, I know my productivity has suffered when I'm in the thick of things. Despite that, it's not bragging to say that I am the most knowledgeable of my peers at work, the most often to participate in projects/planning, and I still manage to get everything done. It could be better and I could do more, but I'm counting it as a win that I'm not fully withdrawn from everything.

I'm a 39/f HR professional. I've had frank conversations in the past with my boss about depression because I really do believe it needs to be de-stigmatized and I have nothing to be ashamed of. 

That said, one of my coworkers has left and now we are hiring 1 person but we are advertising for 2 levels of position. One of the levels is a promotion to a manager role in my HR function. If I get that position, then the other position is at my level and we could hire from that candidate pool.

I'm really not sure if I should even bother applying. I know there are other strong candidates in the pool. This should be \*my\* promotion because of where I am career-wise. If not for this latest bout, I'd probably just be getting reclassified instead of needing to apply.

I've been working with my doctor for the last several months to try to adjust my meds to get me back on track. I think I'm just about there and I'm actually looking forward to doing projects and such again. I just don't know how to convey that in this situation.

I really want the promotion. I'm afraid to apply because 1) the self-doubt/self-flagellation is still nipping at my heels and 2) if I don't get the job and they bring in someone else, who doesn't have the institutional knowledge and skills that I have, I'm going to end up essentially training the person in the job that I should have. I'm really worried that will sink me right back into a deep depression.

I'm going to apply because I can't \*not\* take the chance that I will get it. I just needed a place to vent this a bit.

In the last 5 years I have tried approx 10 ssri's and snri's, none of them worked. 

I have tried cbt therapy, which one time seemed to work but was more a false sense of happiness which didn't actually fix anything. I have tried many therapists and they have all been in vain.  Also I just don't have the money to do it on a regular basis. 

Ive been an inpatient in psych hospital which did nothing, I was sitting around all day doing ""activities"", art therapy, yoga, library, etc. And keft wondering whats happening here? What treatment is on offer? Wgat are they doing? I was met with jargon when I asked questions. 

I wasn't seen by anyone for a few weeks after I was admitted and as an outpatient after that was put on a course of cbt sessions, i did 8 approx.  All that seemed to do was waste time and make me poorer. 

I suppose the main reason I feel depressed is that I see no point in anything, like what am i doing for the next few decades that would be worth doing? The answer is nothing for me. 

I was only diagnosed with avpd since last October when I was admitted, it was a surprise to me but that's the way I always have been. I was bullied in school so stayed on my own to get away from that, it's a habit that I still have.  

Predictably I have no friends or relationships, yeah really none. Doesn't look like that will change but I don't even care. 

I think if I am to get any relief from depression I need to have a life worth living, something worth doing.  But I have no idea what that is and am doubtful if it will ever happen.

To make matters worse this wave of depression hit me on a Sunday and a lot of my relatives visit my house. I haven't been out of bed the entire day. Being an introvert who needs a lot of alone time to function properly, the past year has been nightmare as I had to move back to hometown due to COVID lockdown.

I have a loving family but it feels like no one understands the notion of introversion. I am losing my mind, I am angry at everything and everyone but I also know that my anger is misplaced which makes me feel angry at myself. I feel jealous that I've not achieved anything even though I have potential and it makes me feel jealous of my friend's achievements. I am self critical that I notice that what I feel and think about others is wrong and that probably has stopped me from lashing out.

ma8txf,"Hi reddit, in the past 2 months I went thru a tough breakup, lost my job and therefore lost all motivation to do things. In some way I feel like I am at the lowest point of my life at the moment, I am alone and far away from family, I moved to a new city last year and due to covid i haven’t met any new friends around me. 

I have been going to therapy weekly and was able to identify my issues. In the past I had a goal in mind that kept me motivated, for 7 years it was to find a job, I was able to motivate myself to keep going in school and was able to land a job after graduation. Then after I started working it was my relationship, I tried hard to keep my ex happy and the relationship healthy, but it didn’t work out in the end. 

I lost two of the most important things to me in the short span of 2 months, waking up every morning is painful and super hard. I wake up just to suffer from my own negative thinking, and with no goal in mind I have zero motivation to get my life together. 

I hate myself at the moment, I don’t know what to do, I am really lost. I am in my early 20s but felt like I have gone thru so much shit already, how do I find that next goal in life? How do I get my life back to normal? How do i fight off the constant negativity and suffering?

grr4fj0,Depression and Alcohol are cyclical.  This is exactly how your post reads.  Alcoholism is also insidious.  The more you drink...the more you want to drink.  Until you decide to stop forever you will continue the cyclical insidious cycle.  The only way you will stop forever is asking for help for the rest of your life.  Really not a big deal.  Strong people reach out for help.  Weak people try to solve things on their own.  90 days rehab imo is the amount of time for a human brain to have a chance on their own to stay sober.  Even after sobriety I would recommend to never stop asking for help.  All easier said than done.,2021-03-22 04:50:14

Also, keep in mind unemployment is fairly gracious today which could potentially help.  A simple solution is to try outpatient rehab.  Yes, this does exist.

I’m starting to think it’s too late and that I’m too old to return to college or find a career that brings some sort of meaning into my life.

After I left high school I became reclusive, I stopped talking to my friends and would only leave the house for work. The world was just too loud for me. There was always too much going on and It constantly overwhelmed me.

I would spend days at a time in my room without communicating with anyone because I hated the thought of it. I began to drink heavily to deal with the pain of life. But it just made it worse, I started becoming depressed to the point that I knew that I didn’t want to be alive anymore. But in the end I couldn’t go through with it, I didn’t want to hurt my parents. I didn’t want them to be anymore disappointed in me. 

I started to deny all feelings and emotions I had, to the point of it became second nature to me. For about a year I didn’t feel happiness. The only thing I could feel was misery. Throughout everything I had one friend that wouldn’t leave me alone and would always keep talking to me no matter what. He never knew about my pain or depression, but he saved my life. He once told me that all he wanted was for me to be happy with my life, the same way he was with his. 

Recently I’ve found a girl that makes me the happiest I’ve ever been. She understands my pain and has helped me more than she knows. Without a doubt she’s the most amazing and powerful person I’ve ever met and I love her more than life itself.

ma7hly,"is anyone else suicidal over cultural differences?

A bit of background information. I'm 21, F, living in a close knit Bangladeshi community in the UK. My family are pretty ""high up"" in terms of popularity, everyone knows who my dad and his brothers are.

I'm bisexual and non-binary. Throughout my life, I've noticed I've never fit in this culture. I stopped being religious when I was around 13 when I found it was detrimental to my mental health. Prior to that, it would be safe to say I had major anxiety issues about God, and going to hell to the point I remember my cousins would have to comfort me every night when I was around 5 because I'd be scared of judgement day.

I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ocd when I was 14, which I truly believe is because even back then I knew my life wasn't really mine and I would have to live within the family rules as long as I live (marrying someone who they agree with, not moving out until marriage, presenting myself a certain way, etc), and also probably due to trauma from growing up in an abusive household (nothing out of norm for brown people here).

I found some freedom when I went to uni, even though it was impossible to make friends since my parents made me come home every weekend. I still had my own space, could smoke, could drink, could do whatever I wanted and not constantly be looking over my shoulder in case one of my taxi driver ""uncles"" sees me.

But I'm graduating this summer, so I'll have to move back. And I can't go back into that household and live like I did when I was 17, I really can't. It's hard enough in the summer.

What's worse is I have a boyfriend now who I've been basically living with while I was supposed to be in my uni house. Being there with him has been amazing and I'm not ready to give that up. He insists just because he won't see me as often/very often at all, it doesn't mean it's the end for us. But I can't help but feel like he'll leave because everyone else has due to my family. And the longer you spend away from someone, the more likely they are to fall out of love with you.

I just don't know what to do. I feel like after graduating, my life is just going to fall apart. I'll be their pawn again. I've thought about killing myself so many times over this. 

I've talked to so many therapists about this, who just don't understand. I can't just leave. I love my parents, I can't bring shame on them like that. I know how troubled my mum is, I know if I bring shame on my parents, my dad will blame her exclusively and she will do something drastic. 
I was hoping someone here might have some experience with the same thing.

How do you escape this while keeping both yourself and your family happy enough?

ma7h43,"I'm 21 and I feel that living in a small town in Brazil really limits my options in regards to what kinds of jobs I can get. Most jobs here are in the industries (plastic bag making, wood work, etc) or in sales, something that doesn't fit my personality at all. Other than that, my town is good if you want to start a small business and decent if you want to go into the skilled trades. My dad, my grandfather, and even my dad's grandfather were all into the skilled trades, stone masonry.

Currently,  I'm working for my dad, who's a well-known stone mason by trade here, but since I'm his son, he pays me what he says that I deserve, which, damn, is less than minimum wage. Plus, I feel that he doesn't give me opportunities to grow into this profession and try to do new things, so it seems that I'll be stuck in here forever. And, honestly, hearing that I deserve less than minimum wage for really harsh work in the heat of a tropical country is shattering my heart, destroying my self-esteem, and wiping out all the respect I have for myself.

Since most jobs here are in the industries or in sales, I decided not to go to college. You may ask, ""Well, then why don't you just move, dumbass?"" It turns out that I have a two years old sister whom I feel very responsible for. She's been a light in the darkness of my life and I love her so much that I promised to myself that I wouldn't let her become someone like me, suffer with depression, have no social life, and etc. I need to be close to her because I want to guarantee that she'll grow into a happy, healthy adult satisfied with herself.

Apart from that, I've been into creative writing since I was 16. I've written five books so far, plus many other short stories, novellas, and manuscripts that weren't finished. All those books were terrible, but, deep down, I feel that if I continue to put in the effort to improve, I'll eventually break in, since I've evolved a lot throughout the years. I'm now writing stories aiming at being published in the US, since literature is treated like garbage in my country. I plan on using writing critic groups to help me polish my manuscripts, since I'm not a native speaker, of course.

I love books, really. They've been my best friends for years and made me feel less alone. When there was no one there for me, books were my safe place.

Problems is, since I'm really afraid of failing as an author and keep earning less than minimum wage for the rest of my life, I keep trying to find a way out. I change my mind about what I should do with my life every single day, literally, and this is driving me crazy, because I'll never get anywhere if I'm always changing plans. Basically, I decide that I'll do something, then I realize that I can't do it where I live or that the job would take away all the time I have to write, and then I give up on it.

Maybe my best option would be to keep watching Youtube tutorials on stone masonry, save money enough to buy my own tools, and then set Google and Facebook ads offering my services. At least I would still have time to write.

Wish you guys can give me a little light here.",2021-03-22 03:39:20
grqxs2u,"Your sister definitely sounds like a light in your life, something that can provide purpose, but don’t feel guilty if you still feel like branching out.

Your dad is definitely a major cause for your bad feelings. Working on that issue, perhaps through therapy, could make you feel better about it. Sounds like you need to achieve some level of peace and your dad in the way he treats you is ripping that from you.

It sounds great if you have the energy and focus to write. A lot of people have the situation where their mental problems prevents them from functioning at all, so you’re ahead of the game. Keep up the writing definitely and join those critic groups if you feel like it.

That stone masonry plan could work but do you like/enjoy doing it? That’s the major thing to ask yourself.",2021-03-22 03:54:51

Stone masonry is not my passion, of course, but if I can make my own hours (avoiding the hours of the day when it's too hot here) and earn enough to live decently, then, yeah, it would be nice. Plus, time outside of work would be time truly outside of work, giving me more time to write than many other careers that take most part of your life.

Currently, I'm in a bad financial situation to pay for therapy, but I apllied to a free therapist through the public health system here. It's been one year and half, though, and I didn't get an appointment yet.

In regards to my sister, I can't go away, honestly. If she grows up depressed, lonely, or anxious like me, I would never forgive myself. I could fail in everything in life and still keep going, but if I fail her, I couldn't put up with it.",2021-03-22 04:05:18

What helps me avoid showering is washing my ""bits"" whenever I use the toilet just with a water bottle I leave in the bathroom. Or just quick washes in the sink if I get sweaty.

ma70nx,"When someone says something to me it feels like they're complaining about me. It's worst with my husband. When he shares his feelings it seems like he is telling me I'm not good enough. 

Example: I said ""Thank you for helping me paint the kids' rooms. I'm not very good at painting. You do such a better job""
He replies, ""And yet you keep asking me to paint more rooms.""

So, when my expression seemed hurt he played it off as a joke and I went with it. Still hurts.

Earlier I helped him install something on our boat. Originally he said he just wanted me to keep him company. Then he asked me to hold something and I had to get on the ground. I was wearing a dress and the angle gave me a wedgie so I grimaced. He told me to just go in the house since I was going to make faces and complain. I had to practically beg him to just let me change and come back to help. When I did come back he reminded me, ""if you don't want to help, don't fake it. You don't need to make excuses.""

I got very defensive and blew up at him. I had to apologize again for taking my anger out on him. 

Another time one of our kids was asked to do a chore that isn't usually their job. When she complained he told her to go upstairs because she never wants to help and doesn't want to argue. Then he tells me it's because I never make them do anything, I always give in, that they won't help. I'm trying to not take it personally. I do insist they do chores but not usually when he's home because the added stress when he gets involved (threats of grounding and loss of privileges) so I tend to just take care of things myself or text them my requests so he doesn't have to listen to the arguing. It's when I forget to keep it quiet or when he notices the chore before I do that the kids start a fight with him, that inevitably makes me feel like a failure as a parent.

I've been trying to just shake it off but it is very difficult. The guilt eats away and I feel like jumping to defend myself even though no one is attacking me.

I'm really afraid my depression will prevail and I will stay in the empty hole and lose myself in the absolute dark emptiness... And eventually lose all my friends and my lover because of my emotional problems. 
How do I manage to recognize my right feelings or to find and put my feelings in order? 
And after all that, I often just feel alone and isolated and as if nobody would understand me and that's why it's very difficult for me to talk about my thoughts and feelings because I always think nobody would understand me and I would just talk against a wall and it would be pointless anyway.

ma6qk8,"These past few months have been pretty rough due to personal family issues and my possible (I haven't been diagnosed by a doctor) depression is beginning to interfere with my life. I need to go see someone and get help but I've looked into therapy and I don't think I can afford it. At least four times a week I breakdown and cry for a couple of hours after getting home from work. The smallest things set this off. The most recent episode was two days ago because my boyfriend was asking me what I wanted to eat for dinner and I couldn't decide nor was I hungry. It seems so ridiculous that I sometimes feel like maybe I'm just pretending to feel this way, if that makes sense. Anyway, because of this, I just feel hopeless.

I just graduated from college this past May and continued to work as a research assistant for the lab I worked at during my undergrad while also working a new field tech job. I originally only worked 4 days at the field job and spent one day working on the research, but I moved up in my position and now work 40 hours. I told the PI I would still work on getting the paper done on a volunteer basis. I postponed applying to grad school because I lost all motivation and the PI has been my main mentor throughout the last three years of my undergrad. When I told her about not applying to grad school just yet I couldn't help but feel that I was letting her down. I eased this feeling by knowing I was at least still working with her on the research paper. I know publishing a paper will really help me out when I do apply to grad school, but after thinking more about it I really don't want to go into academia anyway.

Now, I am losing motivation to work on the research project because I don't want to do anything after coming home from work. I technically have enough time to do it, but I just come home from work, eat, and then zone out the rest of the night. And then feel lazy and guilty. I'm not even passionate about the research. I push it off until the last minute before meeting with her to discuss my progress and feel constantly guilty about it.

grrs2xh,">hey. ive been feeling really down lately and need advice here's my issue. 


It sucks that you're feeling down, I'll try to help but remember that this is advice from a stranger. Take it with a grain of salt. 


>im struggling with severe health anxiety, covid only made it worse, 


Yeah that's a common theme for most people, covid just makes life worse in general. 


For anxiety I found that deep breathing, while counting your inhaling and exhaling helps. If thoughts come into your mind, let them go and focus on the numbers. 


Limiting the information you take in can help as well. No news shows, no political subreddits, avoid popular twitter users, etc. These can fuel your anxiety, constantly hearing about all the stuff that's happening. 


For the physical part of anxiety, soreness and muscle tension, ""progressive muscle relaxation"" works for me. It's where you clench a certain part of your body (I start on the face) then relax it fully. Then you move on to the next body part, then the next, until your entire body is relaxed 


>severe lonliness and cabin fever, havent really left my small apartment in a year, 


If it is possible, maybe you can go for a walk outside? Like a 5 minute walk around the block. It helps me get out of my room and makes me feel less imprisoned. I also see people in the neighborhood, and it reminds me that they exist still. 


>and severe stress from really mean professors who give me tons of work and not even getting good grades. 


Yeah school is pretty stressful. I dropped out of high school cuz I couldn't handle the stress. Just know that literally anything is better than a zero. Only did 3 pages of your 8 page paper? That's better than zero and they may give you some credit for turning it in. 


>im dealing with extreme social isolation 


If it is possible can you reach out to someone? Like a friend or family member. This might not work become some people don't have them or that they are abusive. 


Something that makes me feel less alone is watching youtubers, mainly streamers. Especially ones who talk while gaming. I like to imagine they are in the same room as me and I'm watching them play a video game. Idk if this will help you though. Reading books or watching tv shows helps me as well.  


>and my therapist doesnt even respond to my emails. 


If your therapist doesn't respond to your emails, then you need a new one. This is someone you're paying, and if they aren't helping then it's a waste of money. 


On the other hand, once I found the right therapist, my life improved quite a lot. She helped me with my anxiety, and with medication my depression as well. She wasn't perfect, but I usually felt better after leaving her sessions. I had to go through two bad therapists before meeting her though. 


>also i have actual health issues which makes my anxiety even worse. 


This is an area I have no advice for, so I can't really attempt to help here, sorry. 


>no one even really responds to me on reddit. i honestly dont know what to do. 


Yeah that's a problem with reddit, and the internet. Some posts get thousands of upvotes, while others get 2 or 3 with no responses. Hopefully my comment made you feel a little less invisible 


>im not trying to make it all about me i know lots of people are having a tough time right now 


This isn't a selfish action. You are crying out for help, and there's nothing wrong with that. Just because other people suffer worse, doesn't mean that your pain is invalid or not important. 


>i had to drop a class because i was failing it, wasted thousands of dollars, and im probably failing 2 others because of the insane workload.


Failing school is really stressful and it can make you feel like a failure and useless. Just know that it's not your fault if you're struggling. 


From what I could gather, you have anxiety (maybe depression considering the subreddit you're on) and health issues that can impede your progress in focusing on school. 


Anxiety/depression can mess with your executive function system, which can make it difficult to focus on tasks, it can fuck with your memory which can mess with learning information, it can lower motivation to complete a task and make you feel apathetic towards it, you have less mental energy because of the anxious thoughts and feelings, and many more things. 


If any of these things are happening to you, just know that it's not your fault. You're not a ""failure"" or ""useless"" or ""broken"" or ""lazy."" You are suffering from a MENTAL illness and it takes much more effort on your part to do tasks. 


If it is possible, I suggest asking your professors for help. Explain that covid is making things more difficult, or talk about your difficulty in completing the tasks, etc. Of course some professors are just assholes, but some would be willing to give you some slack.  


>and i dont even have money for a psychiatrist they are 200 dollars without health insurance. i used my stimulus check for a therapist. Lol


Some therapists operate on a ""sliding scale"" where rates are based on the amount of income you get. I suggest asking around for that. There is also new therapists at college who work for lower rates, although the therapy itself can be slightly worse quality because they are learning. 


Hopefully this big comment ramble mess helped in some way. These are just suggestions, do if it you feel like it or don't if you don't. You know yourself and your situations more than a random redditor does. This is just things that helped me, and I apologize if I told you something you already knew

Then, I grew up, now i'm an adult. And now I see what a let down life really is. You think its gonna be fun, interesting, but its not.

Growing older, and working a normal job, coming home, spending some free time, and repeating, like theres no meaning to it. Life is cruel, people living in warzones, homeless people, people in bad situations. Back when I was a kid, i knew what made me happy, video games, free time, candy. Now... I dont even know what could make me truly happy. Unless I could somehow fix all of my personal issues, some of which are completely impossible to change.

All in all, life seemed like this amazing race, and then you get to the end and realize there's nothing interesting at all, Just doing stuff day by day until you die.

Everyday I feel like I’m not good enough, girls only like me for my looks but the second the get to know me they ghost me. I can’t seem to have a relationship with anyone. The only meaningful relationships I have had was in Marine Combat Training. But after that was done all my good friends left. Generally in school environments I keep to myself I don’t seem to connect with really anyone. I think people like me but I just feel like they don’t really want to know me, they just think I’m friendly. 
             I find myself to be a very slow thinker. Simple tasks I stress out about because it takes me a long time to complete them and I don’t want to be seen as stupid. I almost silently have a mental breakdown when anyone says I’m not good enough or if someone says I’m weird. I can’t stand thinking I am someone else’s burden. Sometimes I just wish I would be able to take a bullet or just die for one of my brothers to prove that I would do anything for them. a lot of people in my life have told me that I couldn’t make through marine corps basic training. I know that I proved them wrong but even still I feel like my incompetence to complete somethings eats me alive inside.I was guide in MCT for about a week and then squad leader for a week. One of the instructors saw that I would put out the most on buddy drags up the recon hill I had so much confidence back then. I love being a leader I never give myself anytime I would always talk with everyone and see how they were doing. I dealt with marines getting 6105’s and just having issues. I could just tell they were in distress they didn’t need to tell me. If they said they were okay. I knew they weren’t and I just tried to be a good friend. No one has really ever done that to me. I only confessed to my best friend in MCT but now we have moved on. I just don’t think that In the schoolhouse environment I can find a friend like that.
        I have only had girls lean on me and just want to have sex. But I just want to have a meaningful relationship we’re someone can look past my flaws and just lay next too.

You need to focus on what you can do, besides dying in combat, not what you can’t do. 

If you’re dealing with actual depression, that slows down your cognitive abilities. Have you actually addressed depression as an actual problem you might have? If not you should. Therapy does wonders if you allow it to. Everyone has flaws, some can be corrected and some just need a perspective change. Therapy can give you the tools to do that.

ma5q4s,"Sorry if this is kind of a weird title. What I mean is that since I was 16 or so, every year of my life (I'm 25 now) I've either been relatively functional or I've been cripplingly depressed. 

This typically happens in alternating years; one year I will be doing well, working regularly, acing all of my college courses, etc. and then the next I will be so depressed that I can barely get out of bed.

I've been consistently taking antidepressant medication and going to therapy for the past couple years and I honestly thought I had broken the cycle, but around summer 2020 I could feel myself slipping back into a depression and now I've completely returned to the pit. 

I think I'm probably going to fail my college classes this semester, I've turned in all of my work assignments late, my room is a disaster, I've gained like 20 lbs, etc.

I don't know what to do. At this rate I feel like there's no way to live my life if literally every alternating year is completely wasted. I'm so incredibly discouraged and I'm starting to feel suicidal again, which is something I'd avoided for YEARS until quite recently.

Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated. I feel like I'm whining tbh lol, but I figured if anyone here would understand this situation, it would be you all.",2021-03-22 02:15:25
ma5pzb,"Hey all, I'm sure posts similar to this have been made before but I really just feel like I need to get this out. I would really appreciate some advice, I know reddit isn't my therapist, but I just want to feel less alone. 

I moved to a new city a few months before covid happened, shortly after that I lost my job. I work from home now at a new job which I am very grateful to have found but its hard. I don't have many friends around me and I'm far from home and very homesick, I don't get along very well with my room mates, and I really dislike the job even though I'm lucky to have it. 

&#x200B;

To top things off, my normal response to a situation like this would be to just start fresh somewhere new, but I'm in a relationship, my boyfriend works and lives in the city and I can't ask him to just drop everything. I really value and love my boyfriend, the relationship just makes me feel so trapped, and like my life isn't my own anymore.

&#x200B;

I just don't know what to do, every day I just feel so stuck in a tiny, claustrophobic miserable little world that I can't change, I know this attitude sucks but I can't seem to shake it. I don't know where my life is going or what the right thing to do is.

The faults were honest and not addressed when previously I mentioned them so I said fuck it when I got depressed and the faults still remain unaddressed by my SO. Maybe if I didn't let my depression win I could have addressed it again like an adult instead of throwing in the towel.

Try not to nitpick yourself or him in these times. To be depressed means you'll inevitably chastise yourself but in the context of the relationship stay open and really try to communicate. It's so difficult because they don't understand but if you can keep to your routines and not focus on negatives you may pull through from the fog with relationship intact.

“If I died now, I don’t think I’d really care.”                 
“Dying sounds like a better idea then sleep.”                
“I wonder how it would feel to stab my heart?”          
“How painful would it be to drown right here?”        

They’re random and very sudden intense thoughts. I get a strong impulse to act on them, and very nearly have many times. I don’t consider myself to be an impulsive person, I make calculated decisions, but sometimes I can’t help but act on those thoughts. Just a shame none of them were severe enough to do any damage.

It’s not that I particularly want to die, but I want some kind of relief. Nothing else has worked so why not? I’m past the point of caring that my family may mourn me even. I know that’s selfish, but it’s the honest to god truth and I’m tired of denying it. If it meant the end of so much pain, if they only knew what it would do for me, they’d celebrate. I’d live my last day saying goodbye, and finally be put out of my fucking misery.

I used to be super depressed and hopeless, and it was really quite crushing. I can’t begin to describe the feeling. But now, it’s like I’m bored with it. I’m lethargic, tired, and live with a constant dull ache. It’s a constant painful hum. I can even tune it out sometimes, but I’m always reminded of it eventually. It’s tiring. Mentally. No matter what I do, what temporary pleasure I have for an hour or a day, I always fall back to this. It’s unavoidable. Undeniable.

I will *always* be this way.

If this is the case, then there’s no point in continuing. Even if I have ambitions and fulfill them, I’ll just want more. It won’t be fulfilling. Nothing is anymore. All of my success and failure is dampened by this hum. It tears me up. When I fail I don’t try anymore and when I have success I count the days until I fail. If this will be the reminder of my life, I’d rather die. I’ll have all the good times from before this still, but I know I’ll never move past this. If this is what it’ll be from now forward, I’d rather not move. 

I’m so tired.

So I’m writing out this rant in hopes that some Internet stranger can tell me it’s okay. Maybe someone can find me a temporary reason to continue. It’s pretty selfish, right? But I’ve become a pretty selfish person this past year.

Besides, isn’t that why we all post here? To get temporary praise to hold our inner demons off for awhile? Then we come back and write out our miseries again, and collectively feel sorry for ourselves.... aren’t we a pathetic bunch.

Anyway, that’s all there is to it. My rant. That’s it.",2021-03-22 01:50:38

ma54ew,"Hey Redditors-

Thanks for all the great posts on this thread- they have given me a lot of comfort . I am having a really hard time right now and just wanted to get your advice. I’ve scheduled a therapy appt for Friday but this feels like it needs to be addressed. I’ve always had depression but this feels different. 

Feelings- Husband with 2 small kids 

I feel overwhelmed by work, child, home and marriage responsibilities. I feel like i can’t possibly do everything. I feel like every day i am slipping further and further behind. I have dreams where i am drowning and can’t breathe. I’m getting a full nights sleep and am waking up exhausted. I feel responsible for everything and also totally depleted and small. I’m not even able to take care of myself- I’ve stopped brushing my teeth and washing my hands. 

I keep having awful thoughts about committing suicide. I don’t know where they are coming from. I keep thinking about the swing set belts in the front yard, or mixing laundry detergent with insecticide to make a poison gas. Just today my brain was like “why don’t you walk into traffic”. I feel a desperate need to escape - but escape what? What does that even mean? Escape a beautiful day at the park with my wonderful family? 

It’s totally irrational. I have a wonderful life. I’m just not finding any happiness in it. My wife even offered for me to go take a vacation but i can’t think of anything i would enjoy doing. If i had free time i would just go to the courtyard Marriott, turn off the lights and lay down in the darkness.

I feel like i can never rest. I am always on edge. I can’t relax. I feel like a hunted animal. I feel anxious and tense. I feel afraid that I’m going to do something terrible.

I feel like i can’t do this anymore. I just want to have an accident and go to the hospital. I want to take something to knock me out and never wake up. I feel that this Thing- that has been here my whole life- is right behind me waiting for me, and i don’t have the strength to fight it off. 

I feel directionless. I don’t know what the right thing to do is- move to Dallas? Move to Asheville? Quit my job? Find a new job? I know that moving jobs or places will not get rid of the Thing. I can’t think about the future- it seems gray and murky. I’m barely making it to the end of the day. 

What should i do?",2021-03-22 01:47:47

I feel like shit and I was put on meds three years ago and I still feel the same. Even thought I’m trying to be more active and eating better and slowly losing weight. I still just feel like nothing I’ll ever do with change my physical appearance. That’s the most important part and if you don’t have that you can’t be happy, you can’t be around people and you can’t be loved.

I first was depressed at 13, tried medication, saw a ton of therapists, tried changing my lifestyle and no matter what I tried, even if I felt better for a little bit it would always come back. I gave up trying to get better plenty of times. I hated myself with the same vigor you hate yourself with, but with my own personalized reasons. Sometimes I still don’t like myself but I’m learning to pay a little more mind to the positives. I’m 29 now and only this past year did I get a correct diagnosis and find a therapist who’s actually helping.

Don’t feel bad for feeling defeated, or even giving up on “getting better” if you have for the time being. It’s insanely hard to keep trying when nothing has helped, and when your efforts aren’t having results. People act like if you just keep trying that things will just get better automatically but it often isn’t the case. There’s really always just a chance that the next thing will help.

What makes me sad?

**1**\- I left my country because the economy sucks and it is impossible to progress, especially if you are an orphan. 

**2**\- Not having finished college and feeling that at my age (25 years old) I should be at least halfway through it. I should be at least in the middle of a career.

**3**\- Living just to survive and trying to don't drink lots of pills (like I did many times in the past, trying to kill myself)

**4**\- Remembering that the guy who abused me when I was 15 still has pictures and videos of me and that maybe they can and videos of me and that maybe they can be on the internet but I can't report it.

**5**\- Having to decide what direction I'm going to take. How the hell am I going to pay for my college. What the fuck I'm going to study. And common dramas for people my age, I guess.

My problem is not that I cannot do it. I know that I can if I tried. My problem is that for whatever reason, I see no value in those things.

Its mostly based on loneliness as I always struggled socially and was unlucky with friends. My partner lives in another country so when I see him I am actually happy and the bad feelings disappear. Unfortunately pandemic makes that impossible right now.

So in the meantime I'd like some advice how to manage living with my parents please. 

My dad is extremely critical of me, always looking for a fight. He's always angry and negative about everything in life. I love him but I just am tired of having an otherwise good day being ruined the moment we interact. 

At the moment he's in the living room nursing an injury so if I dont want to be in my room, then he's going to be there so I cant just avoid him. And I dont find that helps anyway. 

So I want to work on my depression without being bogged down by this person. I want a calm happy day without being called nasty or that he's given up with me for the 100th time. 

Is there anyway I can live happily on this environment?

Thanks",2021-03-22 01:08:48
grqeeau,"I don't have a definitive answer for this, but I'm going through something similar. Clinical depression for the last 10 years, moved back in with my family due to COVID-financial difficulties. I'm seeing a therapist again and while it's sometimes impossible to ignore or silence, whenever my dad wants attention, validation, or brags, or picks a fight, I'm trying to go in my head 'that's great for you, dad, but this is your stuff, not my stuff'. It doesn't always work, but creating that separation - that he is picking a fight for *his* sake, not necessarily mine - helps. He clearly has issues, issues that are his and not yours. 

I agree it's difficult but I try this, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't and I feel bogged down anyway. Hope you manage this. Is it a temporary situation? It is for me, I hope, so I think 'where could I be in 6 months-1 year? Could I be somewhere else?' and use that to hope",2021-03-22 01:12:16
grqg3hy,"Thank you I appreciate your reply. 

Some years back I realised that it wasn't my fault and that he has something else going on. But he doesn't understand what depression is and he's too stubborn to get himself treated or diagnosed. When he was taken into hospital recently the paramedics had to tell him to ask for help instead of saying he was fine. He almost died but kept saying ""I'm fine"". 

So hes not going to change and if I told him ""dad I'm trying to get over my depression, please stop finding fault with me"" he would likely say ""I thought u were over that, oh you're saying it's my fault"". 

Even though I know it's not my fault his groaning and negativity feels like an angry dog barking all day. You just cant ignore the sound even if you try to focus on something else.

I’ve been suffering with depression for the past 4 or so years. I’ve always been a very emotional child, in my recent years I’ve come to understand things, not sure if any trauma has been the cause for my depression because my early teen years weren’t depressive. I only started getting depressed around the age of 14/15. 

For the past two years, it’s transpired, it’s less a cycle of crying into my pillow for reasons I don’t get, it’s been more of a numbness, but still feeling. 
I guess, less of a numbness and a lot more of a out of body feeling. I feel disconnected, I feel like I’m on aeroplane mode constantly. Nothing I’m doing is making sense, why am I here ? What is life about ? Is it about money ? Love ? To me, it seems like life is empty, and everyone around me is blinded by Riches and lust. 

I feel like I see things no one else can. I feel like I’m prepared to make sacrifices and put myself through extremes if Necessary. I’ve never had any dangerous / harmful thoughts towards anyone. But I feel like I’m capable of destroying this world, I feel like if it came to the end, I could take on anyone. I’m not egotistical, I have been rather vain about myself in the past, but I don’t care much for that stuff anymore. I only care about my goals, but feeling as if I’m not really here to work on them, and my body is just naturally doing that while I’m backseat, is frustrating. I feel blind, my vision is perfect, but I can’t stay focused. 

I’m still depressed though. I can’t cry anymore. I used to cry into my pillow, I shared a room with my sister, I never wanted her to hear me cry, so I buried my face into my pillow, I’m sure she never noticed, she was always asleep. I think a lot about people finding my body, the thought of dying crosses my mind a few times a day Atleast. I strangely romanticise my death, even though no one would care if I passed. Everyday is a struggle to get out of bed, it’s like an aching in my body, I’m in so much pain. I am haunted by things that have happened to me in the past.

grr2o08,"Next might be augmentation with a second medication, commonly bupropion, an NDRI. After that you might end up switching to another medication class, like TCAs, MAOIs, etc. or augmenting with something like anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, mood stabilizers, etc. It can be a guessing game or a lot of trial/error, but usually there's some logical progression from medication to medication. For me it was sertraline, then sertraline+bupropion, then sertraline+bupropion+vyvanse (for ADHD), then sertraline+bupropion+vyvanse+aripiprazole, now sertraline+bupropion+adderall (still for ADHD)+aripiprazole and ketamine infusions once a month. It's going pretty well, not perfect, but I have (mostly) the relief I've been chasing this entire time, and that's what matters.

It's too early to give up and resign yourself as incurable, there's just far too many treatment options available to be able to make that call IMO. By no means does it mean you *have* to try everything out there, just give it a damn good shot.

Two different antidepressants with no response or insufficient response is usually the bar (it varies) for treatment-resistant depression, as far as I know, it should qualify you for ketamine infusions (if you're able to afford them) or Spravato (intranasal ketamine, should be covered by insurance), should you choose to go that route.

I hope you're able to find something that works well for you without too much trial and error. Once you start finding some relief, maybe it will help motivate you to keep pressing forward.",2021-03-22 04:35:25

If it's not specified, it's probably racemic, since I usually see people advertise/charge more for s-isomer.

For the aripiprazole, I can't really say, anger was never an issue I had. It can go both ways, apparently. It can reduce anger especially if it's caused by psychosis but it can also increase agitation. I guess it's worth giving a try, though the side effects can be less tolerable for people.

More than a few of you out there may know about this one.

I want to go back to the days of 04-07. I want it so desperately. I felt everything back then, joy, sadness, ecstasy and sorrow. It was fun, boring and all kinds of in-between.

These days I feel next to nothing. I'm about to become a father for the second time in, what may be, just a few days time and I don't really look forward to it, I'm not regretting it either. There is just this whole lot of nothing.

During these past few years I've caught myself using social media, something I usually never ever use, to look up people that was important to me back then, be it friends, flames, even an ""enemy"" or two, just to get something to take me back, if only for a little while

Those days were full of laughter, cries of thrill, shouts of anger and sobs of despair and of the broken hearted

I want to go back to that those years and just set them on repeat.

I feel like I'm late in life.

I got my second, and only somewhat useful, journeymans letter at the age of 29, same year we got our daughter. A wonderful little thing, who's turning three next month, and who that should be the bright shining light in my life, but really isn't. I will raise her right, protect her from harm, try to give her the skills she needs moving forward, but that's about it.

Even though we probably could by a house in a relatively short time, I've begun to wonder, why? Why even bother? We buy a house, but it won't be that many years until it doesn't matter anymore.

In the past, we've talked about three children, but that would probably only have been practical if we had gotten the first one five years earlier, though that would have been extremely irresponsible, as we had next to none financial stability, due to me skidding around the educational system and being completely and utterly unable to find a part time job of any kind at all.

Back in the day, I had so many dreams and aspirations. Every single one of them got busted, no matter how low I set the bar. So now, I don't dream, I don't hope, I don't aspire to anything, not anything at all, because why bother? Even if it should by some miraculous way succeed, what does it really matter?

Back then I had hobbies, things that brought me great pleasure and joy. All of it is empty now. All of it.

Those days, back in 04-07, I lived, I really truly lived. These days I'm just waiting for it to be over, and if I could do it back then, when there was life instead of emptiness, I wouldn't be happy, I would be Grateful.

ma3by7,"I'll start by stating that I'm the U.S. so Healthcare can cost quite a bit. My current job offers me benefits since I've been here a few years. When I asked about how to go about getting mental help I was pointed in many directions. I was hoping my benefits would cover a trip to see a therapist, but it turns out my insurance only covers me for a certain service called ""BetterHelp"". I'm not sure if you're familiar with it but that service has been in quite a few controversies regarding how legitimate it is and I actually did give it a shot to no help. I was in contact with a therapist on there for a few months but all they had me doing is making goals, giving me breathing exercises, and telling me my emotional and mental issues are something which can be fixed with just making goals. I have been having really bad urges lately, I work in parking garages and sometimes they can reach up to 14 floors and the top floors are often wide open areas with low barriers and I often contemplate just hopping over it. The only thing keeping me willfully living is the thought of my friends and family and waiting for a new season of my favorite anime lol.

Im only 15 and i know its stupid to be so pessimistic about school and stuff but i go to a small private school full of assholes who are just awful to be friends with. I cant move schools because there are literally no other english schools where i live so if i stay here im basically  gonna go through high school with no friends and the thought of that terrifies me.

Im scared ill never have any fun memories of high school having friends and/or relationships. I know i have many years ahead of me but i have no clue what to do to put myself out there. 

The worst part is is that i dont even know if ill even be a good friend because of my depression. Im going on antidepressants soon though so maybe thatll help but i still dont know what to do about this loneliness.",2021-03-22 00:16:05

 There’s dust on the piano keys. I guess that doesn’t mean much. It sits in the corner of my room more like decor than the instrument it is. Taking up space as a marker for the silent ring of neglected pasts. Things that beat against the walls of my heart so intensely they burst out. Caring too much, needing too much and leaving nothing but a hollow ache. 

There’s dust on the piano keys. It still doesn’t mean much. When I try to play it coats my fingers, sticking like ash and reminding me of the murder I committed. Death of what exactly? I’m still unsure. But it was my hands that pulled out a last breath. Squeezing tighter and tighter around a pulse point until its final beat. Out of time and out of tune, I put up a headstone. 

There’s dust on the piano keys. It surely doesn’t mean much. In fact, it’s fitting. Fine particles blanketing white and black paint a picturesque greyscale. It accents the rest of my room. Bringing out the fine details of closed blinds, broken lightbulbs and overflowing waste. Really it’s a designers choice. Letting it all grow, grow, grow until it molds a life of its own. 

There’s dust on the piano keys. It doesn’t mean much. Its once pearly teeth mock from a distance. A cheshire smile whispering words of failure, glinting with a cruel mirth as it scrutinizes. Sunken eyes beg for comfort and instead sink further into the abyss. There’s nothing left but cold floors and encroaching numbness. I let the lacking lullabies put me to sleep.

This might remind you of bipolar depression at first, and I thought I was bipolar as well, until I spoke with bipolar person they said you have to have mania or hypomamia to be bipolar. So now I don't know what I have anymore, do any of you have the same symptoms?

I was depressed when I was 15 and I took an anti-depressant that I don't remember the name of for 2 years, it worked really well, but after I stopped it I slowly start to experience what I am experiencing now, depression for a week every month.

I just want to know if I am alone or not.",2021-03-21 23:07:21
ma1nwp,"I’m slow as hell at work. In my off time I can barely manage to get downstairs to microwave food. I can’t even really play video-games anymore I feel so shitty. All I want to do is sleep. I’ve been sleeping all day and all night.

When I’m awake keep chain smoking despite never needing cigarettes in the past. It’s fucking up my circulatory system. I feel my heart beating out of my chest. My legs and arms hurt. I feel like I’m going to have a heart attack. I’m like a rat in an experiment... pressing the drug button instead of the food button until I die.

The meds aren’t working and finding the right meds if there are any could take months or even years. 

I’ve spent the past few years self medicating with Marijuana but eventually it stopped working. I saw the path I was headed down... every day I was smoking weed... I was just delaying and worsening my mental health. Eventually it would get to the point where it wasn’t working at all... and then getting off it would be nearly impossible. I’d spent every day for years smoking nearly 24/7 acting like a heroine addict when I couldn’t get more because I would instantly feel like absolute shit.

When I got off it I lost my fucking shit... spent 6 months and all of my savings plus $60k of my family’s money in mental health treatment facilities. Got transported to a mental health ward in a cop car... for the third time in my life.

It’s been three weeks feeling like this. I don’t know what set it off but it’s only getting worse.

I thought I could just be tough and figure it out but it’s not working. I think to myself that this is just temporary until the meds get figured out but  it’s so painful to even exist...

Every second I’m at work feels agonizing... trying to constantly muster up the energy to get things done while my mind is torturing me.

I’m staying at a sober living house right now... and they drug test. If I relapse I won’t have a place to stay anymore but I’m honestly willing to live in my car for a bit to get some relief until I can get my meds figured out. 

I can’t go the rest of my life like this... it’s so hard to even work... I don’t think I can do this even another week.",2021-03-21 23:06:02
ma1akd,Nobody wants to be my friend. I don’t find joy in anything anymore. My girl hates me. I was with my dad the other day going snowboarding and I was romanticizing the idea of jumping out of the car the whole time. While snowboarding I was thinking about to just ride off a cliff and kill myself. I think about getting a gun to blow my brains out. I play world of Warcraft and nobody wants to be friends with me even in the online virtual world. I just isolate. I can’t even use drugs to cope. I honestly wish I had the balls to kill myself i don’t want to go through this life anymore. I’ll never be anything great. I have no motivation all I want to do is sit around and play games all day.

I just want to share what I'm going through, I don't have any therapist. I can't afford that shit. 

All my life no one ever cares for me, family treated me like shit, saying things like I should just hang myself and all the worse things that couldve been possibly said, I've heard it all.. I have no choice but to  stand up for myself feeling that intense anger all throughout... I don't end up feeling defeated while doing so, I feel more joy than pain. I guess that kind of makes me bad?

I hate feeling like a failure, like I haven't achieve anything worthwhile in my life.. I'm just here, existing.. living and working and can't even do the things I love. 


I feel like harming myself, but I can't even do it... I know I'm here for a purpose.. but I hope I won't feel all of this anymore. I guess I just needed a shoulder to cry on, a friend to listen to.. because it feels like I've been alone for a long time",2021-03-21 22:32:39

ma0ocq,"A second, a minute, an hour, a day, a week, a month, a year, as time passes thoughts come and go. Dreams and aspirations shift and change, becoming one thing or another.
Hopes shift and the waves rise and fall, vices fail and become replaced by others.
Between the distractions the pain and momentary bliss one thing remains constant. 

Regret...

I regret this life ever coming into existence.
I regret my beginning and the times I failed to end it.

I am stuck

Bound by by this mortal coil cock blocked by fear and the few I love from peace.

I will live this meager life in misery until true silence eventually graces me.

Each second the pain grows...
Even as I fight against it... as I write, as I live ,as I eat, as I cry, as I laugh, as I shake in fury, awake or asleep, it makes no difference, for pain is eternal.

Hope is just a pitiful distraction, a lie that we tell ourselves to block out the universal truth.
There is nothing to be hopeful for, if you possess true hope and believe in it than I envy you... ignorance is bliss.

So so pitiful, the only remnant of hope resting dimly in me is from the primal instinct of fear.
Fear that this is all there is for me, fear that I will never feel whole and complete.
I fear regret piling up more and more. 
I fear the unknown, the after, I hope when my eyes shut I may experience Somthing grand to make up for the comedy that is my life. I fear that when I close my eyes for the last time I will find neither anything grand or peaceful. 

These feelings are mostly numb and buried...
I long and hope to feel no more.",2021-03-21 22:18:44

I don't really talk to anyone about how I'm feeling as I'm always trying to help them. I have tried speaking to the health service but they don't care. They keep saying we will call you back and never do or postpone phone appointments. I don't work at school even though my exams/teacher assesed grades are right arrond the corner it just seems like my planned future is too far fetched. I keep fighting with my parents about my lack of work and my substance use. They don't let me see my friends after school anymore as I have come back drunk a few times. I don't know if I am choosing to fight with them deliberately so they end up hating me and stop caring so I can kill myself without anyone caring.

ma0806,"So, a year ago i had serious suicidal thoughts and i wanna tell u how it was for me. 

Everything was seemingly perfect in my life. Still i was the most depressed in my entire life.
I was working in afternoon shifts so I finished in 10pm. 

I was walking home. Few moments back i was laughing with my colleagues. It was a 10 min walk. In half way home 5 min after i said goodbye to my colleagues the feeling just hit me. I stopped in the middle of a sidewalk. Couldn’t move my feet. I felt like i dont have any energy or motivation to move one step forward. I looked up in the sky. The feeling was drowning me. I felt tired, and sad from the bottom of my heart. I wanted to die. If someone would come there and cut my throat i wouldn’t resist. I didnt think of my family, boyfriend or friends. No one was in my mind. Just the craving for death. I wasnt afraid of it. It seemed like the most peaceful thing in earth.

Then i moved. Went home, had a shower. The feeling passed. It happend a few days more. Than i had a breakup and moved out. 
I lived alone and i had everything at home to hang myself. And I thought back to that feeling and i still know that if this happens again and im home alone i wont have a fear in me to do it. 

I dont need balls to get it done. Just this terrible feeling to come back and im gone without hesitating. 

Never told it to anyone how it is for me. But still, when i think back i cry and afraid it comes back and i”ll be gone.",2021-03-21 21:56:52

grqcso1,"Having lost my mother very suddenly 3 yrs ago, there’s nothing that can really help. Apart from knowing that her pain will end soon, what can honestly make this process any easier. It’s awful and I’m so sorry you and your family are going through this. Maybe just accepting that you’re not going to be ok and that the only way out is going through it. 
Even though my moms death was sudden, I still had the fear that it was going to happen and that she would be taken from me early. It was a gut feeling I had for years prior to her death. When it actually happened, it was devastating but that constant fear I had was gone and it was kind of a relief. People often say that watching your loved ones suffering and just waiting for the inevitable to happen is a lot harder than the actual death is. You might find that as well. 
I’m not a fan of the advice of being strong for your family and that this happens to lots of people. None of that makes it easier to cope with. All I can say to you, is allow yourself to feel the emotions you’re experiencing. Vent them somewhere, to someone or whatever way you feel comfortable with. Ignoring them or pushing them down will only make the grieving process harder. Don’t beat yourself about it either, this is an awful situation, why should you have to pretend like it isn’t?!

My heart goes out to you. Time does help and so does therapy or joining a grieve counselling group. It’s not a weakness to be heartbroken over your situation and loss.

m9ypb4,"As I grow older, I have come to realize that the most difficult questions to answer are the ones that disguise themselves in simple forms. 

**How are you?** 

When I was younger, I had a black and white perspective on life and so I would always have an answer to this question because for a kid, how hard can it be? The answer would usually either be “I’m fine” or “I’m not okay”. But now, every single time someone would ask me how I am doing, I’m at a loss for words. I get tongue-tied and it takes me a while to regroup my thoughts to find the right words to say. 

**How are you?**

How do you answer this when you don’t even know how you are? How do you answer this when you know - deep down in your heart - that you are not okay and will never be okay? That all you do every day is just put on a brave face, hoping that one day all the lies you tell yourself will eventually hold some truth to it? How do you respond to this question when at night while everyone’s asleep, you are wide awake and all you can think about is how much you want to kill yourself because the pain is too much to handle? How do you tell that to your friends without alarming them? How? And so, in order to protect the people who genuinely care and want to know about my mental well-being, I lie through my teeth and tell them I’m okay. 

**How are you?**

How am I? To tell you the naked truth, I don’t want to live anymore. Trying to scour the world for reasons to stay alive is exhausting enough, but even more so when you actually do try to survive the daily motions of adult life with nothing to keep you going. Sometimes I just pretend that I am happy and for a split second, I actually believe it. But then, it would disappear as quickly as I would manifest it and I would find myself crying and lying on the cold hard floor of my room in the wee small hours of the morning. Helpless. Hopeless. Heartbroken.

I have already accepted the fact that I will meet my end to suicide a long time ago, but I don’t know how or when I’d actually go through with it. For now, I’m just really trying to stay alive for my dog.",2021-03-21 20:43:24

I also would appreciate knowing how to tell me friends and family I want to die, without them freaking out and locking me up. I’m pretty sure if that would happen, it’s game over. So, I lie too. “I’m good, how are you?” I want to answer “terrible, I’m a useless, negative B who wants to end it all.” Idk how to help, I wish I did. All I know is, I don’t want to live forever. I’m going to be 30 and I feel my life is over.",2021-03-21 22:20:25
m9ykxc,"Dark, I know. A stretch? Most likely. 

But the older I get and the more the thrill of “living my best life” wears off the more cynical I have become. But is it wrong to assume that the world is in fact a very shitty place and we as humans were meant for much more than working most of our adult life only to enjoy our remaining years before we die? 

Now, don’t get me wrong. Some people do manage to escape or completely dodge the daily grind of working a 9-5 and that is something I am envy greatly as I am not fortunate enough to. But for the majority, working to live is a big reality. We’re always taught happiness is most important, but how are we to be truly happy if finances restrict us being able to simply enjoy our lives without the stress of when or how we can afford to do it? 

And then, humans themselves. I am sure most reading would consider themselves good people. Hell, I did. But when you really think about it humans are competitive, they are jealous, selfish and downright mean. Think of how many children and even adults go through life suffering bullying, constant judgement and therefore constant sadness. This is on the surface scoffed at but deep down widely accepted. This is messed up

And then to the big stuff. As far back as ancient texts go it has been documented that humans slaughtered other humans because of beliefs, because of skin colour, because they wanted others land. Even now there is wars, rapes, vicious assaults and crime rife in every part of the world. People fear to leave their homes and women in the most developed countries are warned to be so vigilant every time are out after dark at fear of getting abused or worse. 

What kind of paradise is this? Every day I think of what would a truly happy life for me be. I’ve never been able to answer this, instead these thoughts about everything that is truly wrong in life read their ugly head. 

I may be a pessimist, i may not have any idea where it headed with this. It may be the fact I suffer from clinical depression and this is an outlet for me to release.

I am aware there is beauty in life, but to really grab it with both hands I fear is out of reach from every one of us.",2021-03-21 20:37:24

m9xpu4,"You’ve come to the crossroads, the most important decision you’ll make today for the rest of your life. Will you go on, or will you end it all? Both of these paths are wrought with suffering; but you have suffered your entire life, so this decision isn’t anything you are not used to.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To live on, that everything will be better, that you have friends you can confide in: this is the hope that the world and those around you attempt to instil at every possible moment. Though their words contain half-truths, masking the potential for a better world as a certainty if you can push through your pain, the feelings are real.  
But is it enough for you? You don’t need a pick-me-up, you need love; no, to *feel* love is what you need. If you would pardon my rudeness, you don’t love anybody. The warmth of your heart and the blushing of your cheek, the feeling that you could sleep at somebody’s feet and die happy is something you hold for nobody. You don’t love your parents. You don’t love your friends. You don’t love your pastimes. You don’t love your school. You don’t love your “friends”. You don’t love your teachers. 

But as they say… it could get better. 

Don’t mistake this as the “good” ending though. Deafen yourself to the words of others for just a moment and listen to the road ahead. You will take the burdens of friendship and selflessness into your heart, binding your misery to grow in silence. To be selfish, it isn’t wrong, right? Not when you yourself are on the verge of annihilation? Getting better isn’t a certainty either. It could just make things worse. But again… it could get better. You could learn to love, you could make something of yourself just yet. It’s all up to you.

&#x200B;

On the other hand, you can choose to kill yourself. It’s the easy way out if you sensibly make a slight incision in your wrists instead of options like hanging; peaceful, assuming you don’t snap out of your miserable funk. You’ve tried all your life to struggle against this demon, and you’ve been given *nothing* that you need. You’ve sealed yourself in a coffin while everyone around you brings flowers. To hell with everything, you’ll go out on your own terms. If you’re lucky, you’ll see your funeral as a ghost and watch everyone cry over you. Surely that’ll prove to you how much you meant to everyone.  
But you know deep down that it won’t happen, it’ll just be the end. It will be more an eternal sleep than total annihilation if you are lucky, but you certainly won’t see the mournful tears of those who loved you. You need to feel how much you mean to other people.

This is the ending of least resistance. Deafen yourself to the words of others for just a moment and listen to the waves of the sea. This is it. You will be forsaking the chance of a better future, including the pain said future entails, to put an end to all the misery. If you have a spark of conscience, you will know you are about to damn several of those who love you to struggle with the same demon you ended your life to escape. Are you even deserving of love if you are aware of this notion? No, forgive me. What a rude thing to say.

&#x200B;

But in the end… I’m just text. I just felt so alone, trapped in a sea of people and shows and games and movies telling you that it gets better, to think of your friends while shirking the agony you must be going through. You need to live for others, but nobody will live for you. At least you don’t feel it. This was why you created me, wasn’t it Thomas? You needed to paint this picture of pain to put yourself at ease. You're dying, but I won't let you go easily. Maybe when others come to these crossroads, they’ll be able to reconcile the selfish and the selfless to make their own decision.

But whatever you choose, try not to feel bad about it. Nobody’s trying to paint your worldview a certain colour, you aren’t any more of a coward for choosing either option. It was a free choice.",2021-03-21 19:53:57

I don't wanna be dramatic but they didn't give a shit. Moreover I realized that they just tall to me for the sake of respect not relationship. They never liked me in the first place so they only talk to me when they run out of friends to chat with or seek advice on their own.

I tried opening to them once. At first it worked but after sometime, it all just went into an interogation. More on what i think reather than how i feel. I just wanted to have a real friend to share my thoughts with but never did i ever had such in my 18 years of existence.

Now that my mental state is fucked up thanks to the anxiety of the virus literally in our neogjborhood  and the ambiguity of college, I just wanted to vent it out but I can't. I tried talking to my mom but she just  say they it is my bad attitude that brings me anxiety and problems. I can't blame her though for I am not a good person either and she feels more anxious due to the virus thing.My younger sister also opened up a bit and she feels even more afraid of the happenings in our surroundings.

m9xkf1,"I posted about this in another subreddit but I’m just writing this to kinda get this out of my mind... 

So I was offered a referral for a salaried position that would definitely act as a stepping stone in my career. I’ve been a struggling finding a solid job lead since I graduated college last year, so this referral could be big for me... However, it would mean that I’d have to restart my life over again. Live on my own, in an area that’s kinda cut off from the rest of society. I’d have to move across my state, somehow, even though I don’t have a car or a license or a permit even (too scared to drive). And it would mean I’d be on my own... so I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

On the one hand, career advancement. On the other, my mental health would literally roller coaster beyond belief. I’d been struggling severely, with the whole being stuck inside due to the pandemic 😷 so the thought of being on my own, not having my family or significant other with me... just sounds like a recipe for erasing what little progress I’ve made in bettering my mental state... but again, this job could also bring me out of this funk (maybe) and help me get better in the long run...

What do I do? When my depression is literally the devil on my shoulder telling me to stay where I am and ambition is the angel on my shoulder going “Do it! Take the damned referral!”

m9xdly,"  Slightly over a year ago I got the phone call that my aunt and best friend died of cancer. The first to pass away was my childhood best friend, and about a month later my aunt passed away from cancer too. I remember I got the phone call regarding my best friend on a Wednesday night, I was doing my online homework assignment when suddenly I heard my mom speaking in chinese and heard the word death. I thought maybe it was a distant relative until I heard her mention my best friend's name and I just had this horrible feeling. 

  Then about a month later my aunt passed away but this time my uncle somehow had some crazy insane gut feeling she would pass away that night? Even though she said she felt alright during the day, we all came round her bedside just in case and eventually slightly after 10pm that Friday night she passed on. 

  Suddenly my best friend's favourite song came on just now and I just broke down. I went to both their graves the other day and it's so hard. Life's so hard. I've been acting happy and like I'm alright the whole time but I'm truly not. My aunt was a huge source of guidance to me and my childhood best friend was practically my entire support system. They both knew me so well and accepted me for who I was as a person, as well as guided me through my toughest times. I'm taking my GCSEs this year and it's so stressful. I'm not sure how much more I can take without either of them here. But I guess whether I like it or not life goes on. Doesn't give a shit whether I'm in the right mental state or not. My classmates are super competitive and I got all As but still got the lowest result in my class and my teacher always looks at me so dissapointed.

  And I was previously dealing with ptsd because my dad had anger management issues when I was a child and lashed out on me a lot. Said mean stuff, hit me, broke stuff, threw things around, told me to go end my life etc. The memories still hurt and it's all relapsing now. Now I have to deal with the memories of my dad and the two very important people in my life. Every memory I have with them just hurts me so much. I also have ADD and can never focus but I've been especially unproductive these past few days I hate myself so much sometimes. I'm literally crying typing this and autocorrect has to corrxct my every word. Okay that's all guess I just needed to rant have a good day y'all sorry for the time I may have wasted from ur day.

grqysmx,"That's the fucked up thing about life and death. No matter how much someone means to you, no matter how close you are to someone, no matter how irreplaceable they are, you're expected just move on and act normal like nothing happened like the person who died were just replaceable objects. One of my worst fears is losing my girlfriend. She means everything to me and she's very dear to my heart. If I was to lose her, people's words wouldn't console me. People would tell me bullshit like ""you'll find another girlfriend"" as if my girlfriend is just an object to be replaced but she's not. No one can be replaced. There will always be that void in your heart when you lose someone that's precious to you. I still miss my grandparents, aunt, and nephew even after a while decade without them. Nothing will ever replace them. That hole in my heart is still there. My great Aunt lost her son to suicide 18 years ago and she just lost her other son to a car accident 2 years ago. Before she lost her other son, she still grieved the loss of her first born son. She has attempted suicide. That first week after she lost her second son, she was in denial that he was gone and kept saying he's not dead. Death isn't something you just move on from or forget about. It leaves an irreparable lasting pain in your heart. That's why I believe people shouldn't judge the coping mechanisms of people who are grieving. They may not always be the most healthy coping mechanisms, but people cope in different ways. I cope by escaping reality but a lot of people would say I'm not coping the right way and I need to just face reality. When this is our reality, you can't blame anyone for wanting to escape it every once in a while.",2021-03-22 04:03:27

when I was about 8 (I honestly can't remember, it could be anywhere between 5-13) my mother who has several mental disorders including bipolar depression and horrible anxiety problems as well as being an alcoholic was drunk as usual and my brother and dad were out and it was just my mom and I in the living room, my mom was super drunk and was talking to me and asking me if I would miss her and other things like that. As a young child i was sort of trained not to take my mother seriously when she was drunk by my father, so at this time I didn't take her seriously and before I knew it she grabbed a razor and cut herself and it was quite messy so I saved her and help her as best I could, called my dad and told him my mom cut herself and he come back ASAP, I think he called 911, I don't remember if I did or not. the ambulance came and one of the paramedics talked to me after rolling her away and told me how much of a hero I was and idk why but it really rubbed me the wrong way, I didn't feel like I hero I felt scared and ashamed I didn't help her when she was giving me obvious signs about what was probably going to happen next. I still struggle with this many years later and it's really affecting me poorly and a lot more recently I've come now to terms of how shitty things were sometimes when I was young and I was just supressing these bad feelings and I still don't really know what to do anymore with it, I've tried to get help from counselors, psychologists, etc. but they haven't helped much. idk what I'm looking for from posting this but whatever I get I hope it helps",2021-03-21 19:27:03

Would you think ""oh, what an asshole 8-year-old, how dare he?"" or would you think ""what an asshole expecting an 8-year-old to even understand enough of what's going on to even remotely have a chance of grasping the situation and helping. Stop ranting and blame yourself for getting that kid in that situation""

I'm pretty sure it'd be more along the latter example, so why would you need to judge yourself for it? When I was 8 I probably ate crayons or did some other idiotic stuff. I'd be nowhere near being able to even understand why people are suicidal and how to help them. Nobody should expect this of an 8-year-old, including yourself.

You did much more than what can be expected of a kid. You should be proud that you managed to get an ambulance and contact your dad.",2021-03-21 20:58:28

m9wlop,"I feel like i need to fucking vent.  I am 17 (18 next week). All my friends are 18. I have cystic fibrosis. I am 5'4 due to cystic fibrosis. I think I have depression but my parents are trying to hide it to just being anxiety. As im writing this im balling my eyes out so sorry for the sloppy writing. I am a very lucky person to be living with a big loving family under a roof with lots of commodities. I feel like im always a few years behind everyone else. Everyone else i hang out with and who I graduated with is so much smarter and so much more attractive than me. I feel like i annoy everyone i come in contact with. Everyone has a job and studying i sit at home pretending like im going to have a million dollar idea. My best friend if my cousin who (not trying to sound weird) is basically an upgrade from me, he is more attractive, more sporty, can talk to girls, has done stuff with girls, is more popular and daring. I can barely even talk to a girl. Ive mever hugged or kissed a girl in my life. My mum is a helicopter mum and is so annoying, and my dad cares to much but i think has a little amger problem, but I love them both so much. My little brother is literally the best person in the world ans I cry just thinking about him. My sister is so very supportive of the family and i admire her work ethic. My dog is just the best dog I coulf have ever asked for. I have a huge amount of relatives which are all so supportive and yet i think i have depressjon. Or maybe im just attention seeking j bave no idea. I can barely go out in public because i think peoole are going to look down on me. I can grow facial hair better than anyone in my grade and i think i hate it becuase a girl one day at a festival said i look like a 12 year old with pubes on my face. Fuck you whoever said that. My nana passed away a few weeks ago and I couldnt even cry because i was on medications. i tend to lie to my friends a lot to make it seem as i am interesting but i think they know im lying and havent told me. I dont think i can or will end it all because im scared and i love my family to much. I got given a fine of $1300 for riding an electric skateboard, which is my most favorite thing in the world and now i cannot do it anymore. I have a gastro thing in my stomach so I cannot even take off my shirt in public becuase i will look even more disgusting. I think im just unlucky becuaee bad shit happens to me all the time. I coultn even get my drivers licence so that electric skateboard was my only freedom. Ohh there is so much more but im going to stop.

Ok i have calmed down a little now. I needed to get that out of my system. I have never done that or told anyone any of that and it kinda felt good.

Last year I opened up about having ""anxiety"" to mum and we went straight to the doctor because depression is common in Cystic fibrosis patients. I got onto some medication which has helped heaps up until about two weeks ago. Tonight I have had loads of tingling in my veins and I have cried so much. Im gonna regret it tomoorw i think. But i feel better now i have let it out. Sorry if you read all that but thankyou as well. Good night or morning where ever you are from, hope you are having a better life than me.",2021-03-21 18:53:20
m9w0wd,"Hey all, I'm hoping you can help me a bit. I'm involved with a guy who is depressed. We're not 'official' but have been seeing each other for three-ish months now. He was upfront with me about having clinical depression from the start which I appreciated. I have been depressed a lot of my life too, but I consider mine situational; it comes and goes, and right now I'm probably better than I've ever been. My main struggles are with anxiety and autism.

So far things have been cruisy. I can tell he doesn't have a lot of energy but that's okay with me. But this past week I've found myself anxious about some things and am not sure how to approach them.

He's been much less chatty this week due to feeling down for various reasons. Even when things are normal there'll often be 2 or so days inbetween us exchanging messages. In general I'd prefer to message more than that, but I can make it work so long as I know that the interest is still there. My trouble is that this week, I found myself getting kind of triggered by the lack of communication. I was previously in an abusive relationship where texting was extremely fraught, and my choice of wording in messages was frequently subjected to criticism/used as justification for emotional abuse. I had to walk on eggshells, basically. This was often accompanied by long periods of me anxiously waiting for responses, in which I'd be terrified I'd said something wrong or expressed myself badly or somehow been too verbally selfish in a way that would make my abuser lash out or me, or alternatively, give me the cold shoulder. 

I found myself in that same 'oh my god I said something wrong he's upset with me I should have rewritten my message at least 5 more times before sending it I've fucked up oh god' mindset while waiting for replies from this new guy. Not because he did anything abusive!! But because my last message to him was on Friday and he never replied to it. I (privately) freaked out that my last message to him was too long (it was tbh), too self-involved, too poorly timed considering how down he's feeling, and that he was probably resenting me, etc. I spiralled into a really anxious place and convinced myself he doesn't care about me and that I'm an annoyance. I felt right back in that same scared panicky sick-in-my-gut mental headspace as in my abusive relationship. The fact that we haven't had any conversations about the nature of our relationship, meaning I feel kind of insecure about it, contributed also to my feeling that way. I realised that, in fact, I have been feeling triggered on some level about this every time he doesn't get back to me for a day or two.

The other thing is that prior to this we had been talking about how doing things out in the world is difficult for him right now. I had jokingly asked if he only wants to hang out at my place, since that's all we've done the past 4-5 times we've seen each other (he had to move back in with his parents due to COVID stuff, so his place is a no-go), and he was kind of upset that he gave me that impression, because it's maybe true (right now at least). I like going for walks, or to the park, or to see music, or to restaurants, and I was becoming somewhat confused about why he hadn't brought up doing anything together outside basically since our second date. When I have previously casually mentioned getting sushi or something he never responded to that part of the message. That made me anxious too, because the only reason I could think of was that he didn't really care. I know now it's because it's a huge effort for him to face going out into the world at the moment. I feel like I can work with this... the only thing is hanging out at my place all the time, while fun, can get a bit old for me since I work from home and am here 80% of the time. 

The reason I'm posting here is because I feel like I need some advice in balancing what's going on in my head with what's going on in his. From what I've read in this sub, it seems fairly common that at their lowest the depressed may not respond to messages in a timely manner. I'll talk to him about it... but the more perspectives on how his kind of depression works, the better. My past experience of abuse has made me both proactive and a bit desperate to advocate for my needs in relationships, but I don't want to do so like a battering ram despite how much my anxiety spurs me to do so. I am also not interested in self-sacrificing or trying to save him. That's a fool's game. I just want both our needs to be met and to somehow meet in the middle so we can both feel heard and respected and enjoy our time together. Any ideas? Thanks.",2021-03-21 18:20:42

It’s human - to err is human. Year 12 is the most difficult (in America at least that senior year of high school) and you just started this online school! After a very stressful pandemic year!

In my case my depression has caused me to lose my passions, I feel no pleasure from things I used to want to do, drawing or knitting or crafting. Hobbies are meaningless. I am more likely to hate doing something than liking it. I have no passion, no wants or desires, no ambitions. I have zero purpose to keep going in my life.

At the moment, my cat being my fur baby is what I live for. I live to keep her safe and happy. My own life, however, is dead. I am just a warm, breathing chunk of flesh, taking up resources.

If anyone has experience in this situation i need some advice. How have you gotten over this? When everything is pointless and i enjoy nothing then what am i supposed to do? To try a new thing is a sure way to plunge me into the pit at the first mistake.

Friends and family tell me to do what makes me happy in life but nothing makes me happy but my cat. I need to want something in my life to keep going once my cat is gone, but the thought of doing anything makes my heart sink and I'm just so ""meh"". 


At the moment all I can do is play video games. They  help me escape my situation. I'm not necessarily happy, in fact they make me irritable if I'm interrupted, even to my cat.

m9wfj1,"So I've known this guy for about 5 months. We met in a dating app and he swept off my feet right away. That's never happened, even tho I have dated quit a few men. I keep my barriers high and don't trust people easily. But he was something else and I guess he felt the same. I know now, that I've might seemed quit cold since I didn't know where his head was at. If I'd knew about his depression, I would've made million things differently. He's the most sweetest and thoughtful guy I've met. 

But in the beginning, after a month of intensively seeing each other, he suddendly went MIA for a week just when things were progressing. We talked and I decided to give him another chance, since I didn't catch any red flags. I started to think that he might be slightly depressed due to e.g. severe sleeping problems, not eating and talking about depression due to winter. Fast-forwarding to current situation, I asked to have a chat when he went again MIA. He told that he's been feeling blue and might not be able to give me what I deserved. We decide to quit seeing each other, but I could not let go entirely after what he'd told me. I also understood that he hasn't told anyone, not friends or family, about his depressive feelings. He said that the has seeked help, but not sure if he's seeing a therapist. 

After thinking about the situation, I started to send him one or two texts a week. I started panicking that he would do something to himself. His answers are nice and lovely but might take awhile. He said that he would still want to see me when he's feeling better again. Every time I try to offer bringing food or just to see quickly, he stops answering. I don't think he's seen anyone for a month. I don't know what to do. I would just want to give him a hug. Should I keep sending the texts? I feel like walking on the eggshells every time I text him.

grp7d9q,"You seem like a very sweet person! I think it's common for us that are suffering to believe that we are not good enough for others. He said this to you, saying he might not be able to give you what you deserve. 

Of course this is a lie fabricated by our minds but feels true. My therapist has said that we build up this safe space around our depression. You coming into his life breaks this safe space (which is good!) And questions his ideas about himself. It's hard to change and so sometimes it feels easier to push people away, not because you don't want them there. But because you have lied to yourself that they don't or that they are just there because of pity. 

Depression for me always comes and goes in waves. I hope he gets back to stability and realizes you want him for who he is \^^ I'm sure he looks forward to your texts each week and most likely very flustered when you offer to see him, making him not respond. 

I know it can be very hard to keep contact as you get very little from it, I think it's very helpful for him. He should count himself very lucky to have meet a person like you \^^",2021-03-21 19:12:05

Lately I’ve been thinking that if I still believed in the Judeo-Christian God I grew up worshipping... hell, I would spit in his face. And if I went to hell for rejecting his teachings, so be it because now at 24 I KNOW what I believe in and what I want in life. I don’t care what some greater power says when my belief in my own principles goes so deep. 

I know that may not sound directly relevant, but you sound like someone who is also fiercely tender. Like, you’re fighting for close connections to those you love and you’re fighting for a sense of peace and purpose in the short lives we lead.

I think it is a painful way to exist in a world that is constantly pushing us all the other direction, but I feel a great respect and kinship for others who hold that ‘fiercely tender’ part of themselves with a sense of preciousness.

Couldn't admit she did in fact blame me saying I could've done something sooner to prevent or lessen  the episode. She called me a gift in his life at one point during all of this and then continued to tell me it was my fault.  I should've/could've done something.

I agree with your post and have been struggling socially for a long time too. You make a really good point about how humans just seem to *need* this bs hierarchy and incessant superficiality. This to me seems like a very Westen culture, Capitalistic influence, but we can see it everywhere.

In my psychology class, we explored the arguments made by the psychiatrist known as Thomas Szasz, who published a book called ""The Myth of Mental Illness"". In it, he argues that what we refer to as mental illness is just problems in living, and insinuates that the system's pathologizing of the genuine struggles we have is a means of maintaining the status quo by pushing blame onto the individual. Maybe we're the ones that are seeing how broken and toxic modern human society really is, and the ""normal"" people are just the ones who are stupid or delusional enough to believe that everything is just fine how it is.",2021-03-22 07:58:50

Hierarchical systems are indifferent to one's self-esteem; the biggest mistake we make is assuming that value is the product of quantified difference -- that the frequency distribution of an aggregation of individuals' differences along a system's axis produces the metric by which any one constituent's value can be determined. No, the value derives from the position itself within a system, and the function it serves; the frequency distribution is an observable effect of any system, but we should only concern ourselves with a system's affects, that is, its causal inputs as opposed to its abstracted outputs.",2021-03-22 11:10:46

m9vo1q,"Been having a significantly harder time lately. Even though I finally did get one job interview after months and months of trying, I'm at the ""we'll get back to you with more information""stage and it's been a while. My hopes are not high. Additionally, I feel great anxiety about entering society again. I have been in this situation before; I get fired a lot. I have spent upwards from a year in between jobs, but it's been a while. It's been a long enough time that I had mostly gotten over the worst anxieties, and over this mild sort of agoraphobia. It's come back. Pretty much all the progress I'd made has been torn down. It's also come back quite a bit worse since I'm a fair bit older now. Like, I'll be 29 very soon but I have absolutely nothing to show for it. I have accomplished nothing. I have created nothing. I have contributed to nothing. I have spent my entire adult life so far busting my ass and I am still in the same spot I've been in since I was in middle school. No matter what I do, what I try, I can't move forward. Just sitting in my mom's house wishing I were dead. Can't get a job that will pay more than enough to break even on a good day. Even if I do, mom can't afford to live anywhere on her own so I am stuck here. I don't know what to do.

m9utig,"rant as fuck because I dont know what else to distract myself with at this point... last March just before lockdown, I self harm relapsed pretty badly. I bled through my bandage and clothes the morning after while I was at school. 2 days later I was hit by a car while biking home from school. that was my last memory of highschool. lockdown seemed like it was my saving grace to finally let up on school so I could recover mentally from what I was already going through. it ended up being the loneliest I had felt up until that point. to try and solve this I got a job as a night custodian for a school. this put an immense amount of stress on my shoulders, as with covid the requirements for the job on an understaffed team increased, and it didn't help with trying to distract myself from the emptiness I was feeling. Because I was a night custodian, I worked alone for 95% of the job. I had felt more empty and more sad than ever. To one up from that, I realized that I had strong feelings for one of my online friends that I had known for 6 years and was now living in my state. Later I realized that she was very toxic... but that was only after she made me feel the happiest I had ever been and then left me out of nowhere. I had my first real-real heartbreak. it landed me in the hospital because I was afraid that I would kill myself. i started having vivid lifelike disassociations of our relationship over and over again. I had just as many suicidal disassociations too. in an effort to try and improve my mental health, I resigned from work and it felt like a weight had been lifted off of my shoulders. now I am taking community College classes and they have been very hard to keep up with. I don't even know how to focus anymore. I can't ever complete assignments in one sitting even if they are simple and I don't know why. I feel so stupid and ungrateful that I am able to be in this position and not make the most out of it. I don't even know if I am taking the classes for a reason either. I don't know what I enjoy or what field I want to go into or anything close to that. it has gotten to the point to where I get cold sweats and panic attacks trying to even sit down and look at my assignments. on top of that stress, I recently got pulled over for going 50 in a 30. I didn't realize that the speed limit had changed in the area i had turned into. I had also recently gotten my first car, which had not been registered in my name because covid switched the way that the dealer released registration to online and it was apparently backed up. long story short, I could be looking at a $500 ticket minimum. now I have to try and find another job to be able to pay it off. now I feel nostalgic to the past 24/7 and sad that I will never get to re-live what were the good times.

grrqfia,"Hey there,

It sounds like you have a lot going on right now, I’m really sorry things have been hard for you. Remember it’s not your fault you feel this way, but you are in control of how you respond to it now. 

My bf, my sister, my mom (and sometimes myself) all have depression, so I’ve been dealing with it years now. Personal experience has taught me a lot, but most importantly it’s taught me that how you respond to everything is key to getting better. I mean that in the sense of how you respond emotionally to yourself, your feelings, situations you’re in etc. 

My bf is in college too right now, for the first time since he dropped out 5 years ago at age 15. He’s had a really hard year and has found it difficult to keep up with assignments, attendance etc. and gets quite down about it. He sees himself as a disappointment for not being able to just “do” everything he needs/wants to. I don’t see it that way and you shouldn’t beat yourself up over college either. 

Going to college is a huge thing, and it’s great that you’re doing it. I think a huge realisation for me was when my bf and sister both explained how hard it was to do everyday tasks when you didn’t even feel like waking up in the morning, ever since then I see all the little things as huge accomplishments. 

I don’t mean to sound patronising or anything, but honestly I’m so proud of my bf when he manages to get up in the morning and make breakfast. When he logs on to an online class. When he meets his friends after weeks of not seeing them. It’s the small victories that mean the most. I hope you know that even being able to do 5% of the things you want/need to while you feel like this is amazing. You shouldn’t feel remotely like you’re stupid or ungrateful, you’re doing the best you can at a time when things are hardest for you, that’s all anyone could ever ask of you. 

Don’t stress about where this course will take you. If it gives you something to do now and the qualification is useful, then that’s enough. There are endless routes into every job and you’re 19, you have plenty of time to figure things out. I’m 19 too btw and I definitely haven’t got my shit figured out. I think the best thing I ever did was stop caring about it all, in a good way. 

I have a lot on my plate right now. My bf’s depression takes up a huge amount of my energy and I’m trying to keep up with university at the same time. I’ve missed like 50% of my classes and I haven’t seen my friends in almost a year. What I’ve realised though is that my life doesn’t need to be great right now, and even if I’m not doing the absolute “best” that I can, I’m doing what I’m able to, and that’s enough. Sometimes the best you can do is take care of yourself and that’s okay. I’m seeing a therapist and I’ve made a conscious decision not to care too much about my grades this year. The way I see it is I need to set myself up mentally before I take anything else on. The best thing I can do for myself now is get myself to a place mentally where I can start dealing with everything else that I need to. Otherwise it all gets a bit much. I consider a productive day one where I manage to shower and eat. This week was rough, I didn’t do either of those things for days, but when I finally managed to I let myself be proud of it. When I was stuck in a mindset of constantly needing to “do” things that were expected of me/that I needed to do, I felt like I had no time to breathe. Now if I need to take 4 days off to let my brain recharge, I don’t feel bad about it. My point is that you need to allow yourself to feel like this and be able to be proud of yourself for the things you accomplish in the day. 

I think you need to start with yourself. Not the job, the relationship, college etc. Just you. Make a treatment plan, get professional help if you can, try figure out what makes you feel a little better, what makes you feel worse, stay in tune with your emotions. Focus on getting yourself strong so you can start dealing with all these things, knowing that you’re able to take them all on. 

In terms of the relationship, this is probably a good time for you to focus on yourself without a toxic outside influence. As much as you love her, you need to love yourself too.

I would say right now is the most important time to deal with things. Medication doesn’t have to be your first call, but you should definitely talk to a psychiatrist about what’s going on. From personal experience it’s helpful to speak to a psychiatrist before a therapist, their job is to help make a treatment plan for you based on your needs. 

I hope this isn’t out of line but you should be so proud of yourself. People underestimate how hard it is to deal with mental health when others expect you to function exactly the way they do. If you had the flu nobody would expect you to be up and running at 100% (except every boss ever maybe) and your mental health is no different. You need to get yourself well and prioritising yourself and your needs right now is the most important thing. 

Sorry if this is a lot of babbling!! It’s 2.30am where I am and my brain has been on low power mode for a while now. Hope some of it is sound advice. Sending you the biggest virtual hug and I hope you believe that everything will be alright.",2021-03-22 07:58:54

m9ulr5," I'm 17, Asian, and never had a girlfriend in my life. Many people always like to undermine me and say that I'm 'too young' (my mother) or 'just being selfish' when I say this, but it hurts when I actually heard her laugh at me with her friends, mocking me because I was ""I don't look good enough"". The reason why this hurts so bad is because during my childhood girls would always bully me and would make it clear that they wanted anyone but me. The inferiority complex along with its unfathomable anger, bitterness, and sadness is something that will be very hard to deal with in my heart. Why do people laugh at such affairs, especially to unfortunate people like me? Is it all a part of a plan to manipulate and destroy society and the mental health of people like me? I am bewildered and starting to believe that life and everything in the world is one big joke. I grew up in a Chinese culture, and if you know anything about it, face is a big aspect of family. My first visit to Malaysia seeing Chinese relatives during my adolescent years was one of the first times I had been traumatized and broken to the deepest level. They heartlessly, in their own harsh and inconsiderate ways, endlessly spoke disrespectfully foul and evil words against me, never failing to stop as if I was just a piece of crap with no emotions, as if I was worthless. It has been so long in my life, they say, and I still do not have a girlfriend, therefore I am inferior to them in some sense. What pains this to me at the most is that those who do manage to find relationships more easily are the ones who are more attractive in appearance, the bitterness exacerbated upon the realization that they bully others who are not so fortunate in the genetic lottery. I have known such people in my life and it honestly hurts how brutish and harsh humans are. The pinnacle of this painful understanding is that the people who have love in their lives are the exact evil people who don't deserve it, misusing their power.

Why is so unfair to my eyes? I read somewhere in the Upanishads that the Self is the union between two partners' hearts. Love creates a certain chemical benefit to the mind that makes one brighter in both feeling and spirituality. Sure, I could try self-realisation, but with all acknowledgement to avoid anger, sadness e.t.c. in the first place and to practice yoga, why is it taking so long? Is such a stage even real and possible? Why is this life so unfair? Why do people like me inevitably have to suffer with depression, devoid of energy and worn down by the injustice of this world, while the people in power who have access to this state are greedy, manipulative, ill-intentioned, harsh and unfeeling zombies inside? So it is not childish to say that I am sad because I want a girlfriend but don't have one, as it is different when nowhere else is love to be found, not even from family. The only messages I get from my family are reasons why I should just end my life. My mother regularly cheats on husband, and I have recounted on numerous occasions her sleeping with the people who used to bully me at school. My dad is sexually abusive, and only knows how to complain when trivial things go wrong for him, and scorn me whenever I am having problems. Clearly, my life is not something one should want to live. If karma is really so, then I must have been a harsh, heartless, controlling, manipulative, inexplicably evil being in my past life.

\_

Regarding racism, literal relatives of teachers and people in high positions have said unthinkably horrible things about me because of my race. The teachers then tried to justify to me their wrongdoings. I see white privilege everywhere. For instance, when I make one small mistake it becomes a misunderstanding and then people go to immeasurably harsh and inconsiderate lengths to punish me for such relatively small steps, but when the brutishly evil people traumatize me so much, almost nothing get's done about it.

\_

Back to the beginning point, I am Hindu by faith. So my own culture deems me inferior, but then I look at my personal beliefs. The caste system itself shows Asians to be more close to lower caste, with europeans closer to higher caste. When I first learnt about this, I was even more traumatized, and my self worth and esteem got buried deeper and deeper. So in I am inferior to to Chinese culture, as well as the Indian culture in some sense. What's more? Genetic studies also show Aryans to be originally Asian (East asian). Horses, advanced technology, culture, people, of the Aryans all came from China. View Alex Chomsky's answer on [https://www.quora.com/What-race-did-Proto-Indo-Europeans-belong-to](https://www.quora.com/What-race-did-Proto-Indo-Europeans-belong-to) .Then it was the white man who corrupted and manipulated stole our history and our culture. If you also look back in history, it was Zheng He who was so advanced but didn't conquer and enslave others, but rather peacefully traded with them. What did Colombus do? He, so full of pride and ego, subjugated other people. This says alot about the white man, with his inherent nature for ill-intent. You should never trust him, for he comes only to steal, kill and destroy.

A lot of people always poke fun at Asian men for apparently being unattractive compared to whites (neanderthals). But here is the truth that I will reveal here. The ancient wisdom of the Vedas upholds being pure, not in race (foolish idea), but rather in the character, quality and appearance of a person. If the caucasoid is superior, then why does his face show the exact opposite of pure? Hear my words to heart when I say that the East Asian is the most inherently pure (if you see the true representation of the true Asian in Asian films), while the caucasoid of Europe is the most impure. This goes back to my point on ""the true face of ugliness"", anyone who's white or knows white ppl for who they truly are know what I am talking about. Aryan (Asian) is primordial in purity. Aryan is superior (see films). Aryan is the plan. I have had white people themselves even admitting themselves this point to be true. Little does the white man, so full of pride and ego, know that the truth shall come to all, and the vengeance of God shall befall him.

The ever dishonest white man, so full of pride and ego, ignorant of his ignorance yet wise in his own esteem, who fakes history to manipulate others, has always had the fear and insecurity that those whom he lied to would soon discover the true face of ugliness for what it is. Truly, my lovingly concentrated invocations to the creator, maintainer and destroyer of the universe shall make the enemies pay for all the twistedly unfair injustice they have caused in my life.

Such reasons make it hard for one not to engage in such great anger and resentment that floods my heart. If, one day a racist comes up to me and wants to fight me, I would find that to be the best opportunity to release my wrath and the world will see what it means to be Aryan. There are countless other examples which I have forgotten but which still rankle pain in my heart. I swear that every single second I always feel some sense of heartbreak, exhaustion, and sadness in my heart that lives in me.

\_

My life and its countless examples of trauma, racism, discrimination, depression, insecurity, isolation and suicidal thoughts make a great example to the world that God should destroy it very soon.",2021-03-21 16:49:33
grqqyz4,"Hey dude. You sound like an extremely intelligent person. You don’t deserve to be bullied like that. Especially by family. I know it hurts but try to focus on yourself now. Won’t be long till you get into university and not have to face the negativity at home anymore. 

As for a girlfriend, it seems like you want one because some people find you unattractive not because you actually have feelings for someone? Get into a relationship because you love someone and not because society dictates so. Give yourself some time to grow. Focus that intelligence and passion into something positive like your studies. You will find that special person one day who will love you just as much as you do her. Trust me. I’ve seen some people who I don’t find attractive marry beautiful partners.

m9udvc,"Serious question I guess. I'm 22. I've been very depressed and anxious since I was about 13. I've now tried countless therapists, meds, and other treatments and what I've been shocked with is that it's all been the same through all that.


Will it actually get better or do I just have to learn to somehow better cope with the same feelings? It doesn't feel like this will *ever* be gone and if I'm to stay alive for whatever my full time is then I have to deal with.

m9si7x,"My name is Chris...

So its 0400 and my thoughts are racing - after laying for an hour in bed I’ve been reflecting on why I am so alone?

Today is the last official day of spring break and while everyone is out having fun and enjoying life - I was isolated in my house for the past week dealing with the existential thoughts of what is even the point.

To preface this, I was diagnosed with manic depressive disorder at 13 and from then on (now 27) have had my ups and downs throughout life. As a teen I dealt with anorexia which trickled into cutting/suicide attempts. 

Instead of going to school, I decided to work...and I worked inhumane hours between 70-80 a week doing physical labor for minimum wage which helped distract my mind. This lasted all through high school, but made me socially inept in the process.

I never learned how to interact with people and when college came, so did anxiety and panic attacks. I felt my world spiraling downward and eventually saw a  different psychologist to work on biofeedback training which admit-tingly helped quite a bit, along with hypnosis.

Within a year I was so much better - made a ton of friends, was doing great in college, and felt satisfied except for the fact I was without love, romantic that is. I was still a virgin and never had even kissed a girl at that point. Finally at 20, I met someone whom I eventually would marry and for the next 3 years I experienced (initially for 6 months) extreme bliss.

After that period, the real person came out which should have led me to run - but I felt hopeless because of not wanting to be alone. She accused me of cheating on her all the time, prevented me (I allowed her) to not let me see my friends, and would always get upset if she didnt get her way.

We went for therapy as a couple though because our intention was marriage, to which a lot of unacknowledged baggage came out from her past. The therapist told me to support her with that which ended up into me deferring my will for her’s. 

Long story short after 3 years of dating, we got married and 6 months later we divorced. After the 1st month of marriage - It was basically over as we barely spoke to each other and sex was nonexistent.

When she walked out on me, she simply said she isnt happy anymore and is done. She didnt want anything but the car, as jt was a wedding gift and she didnt work. I agreed and we got divorced. Through the process though, she accused me of physically and verbally abusing her and while that was unfounded by lack of evidence (and was untrue), the court had me pay 30k as a settlement.

For 6 months I spiraled downward into a tsunami of depression, crying everyday - losing 30 lbs because I couldnt eat. I began smoking (which is a habit I struggle with today)...I do 2-3 a day now but was one 1-2 packs at that time. I eventually gained weight though because I drank a bottle or two of vodka everynight in order to sleep.

At the start of 2018 I had enough, picked myself up and applied for a job out of state. At this time I was a doctoral student studying cancer in mice - but always had the passion to teach and had been for 3 years during this time.

I landed a job her (florida) and moved from (new york) i to a house I bought for 150k. It needed some work, but i am skilled with my hands after working construction for a number of years. What ended up as a fixed upper turned into a complete remodel. Well over 100k later, and a year of time - I built my home from the ground up.

Life also took a shift and I started dating again - and was at the point of hooking up with a new person each week. But each time I had sex, I felt more and more alone because I was lacking connection. I eventually stepped out of the game which ended up into falling into isolation.

For the next 2.5 years until now, its been the same rinse and repeat with forced isolation from covid (which right before the start in march of 2020- i started traveling internationally and was meeting new people). 

But now a year later - and 3 years in Florida...I have no friends... I have nobody around me I can go to for help...i live in a beautiful place and live in a house to big for myself (as I bought it while I was still married).

On paper I am the admiration of many - working my way out of poverty (I forgot to add I was homeless for a year between 18-19 do to familial issues at home). As I said Im well educated with an IQ of 152 which makes me an anomaly. I ended up obtaining another degree in philosophy and read basically all day to pass the time outside of work.

Financially I am well above everyone else with close to 200k in retirement accounts, my house paid off, no debt to my name and a credit score above 800. I have an emergency fund and invest in crypto, precious metals, and innovating technologies.

I have multiple streams of income and with dividend investing should be able to retire by 35 making a modest salary lf $12k a year based on that alone which as a minimalist is all I need.

My hobbies include workout (I formerly did triathelons) so im in very good shape and pay attention to my diet. I am a phenomenal cook which everyone admires my food on IG, but nobody has ever stepped foot in my house to actually eat with me ironically. 

I do yoga (formerly a yoga teacher as a side job in college) and meditation everyday. I dont own a car but I skateboard everywhere. 

When Im not teaching (which by the way is my only motivation to keep on living as my students depend on me - yet they don’t realize I depend on them more), I do citizen science research and will be setting up a lab at the local college next fall. 

If you made it this far, thank you for your patience. I am at a place where I have attained what I wanted (what people strive for in life) at now 27 and I feel bored with the mundane. The repetition kills me and I wish I had people in person to be around. I miss having the warmth of a person next to me (and I mean that in the non romantic sense) although I do crave the lust of another person.

My want a LTR but without the commitment of marriage....people my age are not about that as the women my age and even in their 30’s are into hooking up due to the social propaganda machines at play.

Society in general does not want to take the time to get to know each other...they want to keep us distracted with all this social media bs and people eat it whole heartedly. Im currently reading Jordan Petersons “12 more rules for life” and he talks a lot about taking responsibility and that starts with action.

The thing is i dont know how to take action when what I want right now in life (other people), are non-cooperative in my attempts of developing any form of cohesive bond. 

Ive done much self improvement and am admired by people that truly know me , but they are mostly people online  or friends of my past that I keep in contact with from time to time.

I tried developing a connection with god, but that is too long of a story to go through. I am an agnostic - essentially cant deny their isnt a god but for all intentions and purposes do not hold my breathe that their is one. 

In conclusion and i guess the start of my day at this point in writing, I just wish I could have this post help me generate some conversation. 

Like an actual conversation as opposed go short term connections that lead nowhere and end up making me feel worse. I want a person/people I can talk to deeply about life’s troubles and can understand this primordial condition we are in. Ideally, Id like to meet up if we are close or make plans fo travel together down the line - I want to visit the nation parks.

Im not opposed to one gender over the other, but as a male - female relationships often times due to human nature tend to get flirty...however, if your not into that, I can essentially turn that switch on and off. If you are not opposed to it though, im more than open to it assuming we connect. 

Anyways, that is my life in a nutshell and I hope you (whoever you are) would feel open enough to share as much as I 🙏",2021-03-21 14:16:13

m9stth,"Fuck me, I use to be so hopeful back when I was twenty, I was looking forward to meeting people in college and it slowly just went downhill. College wasn't what I wanted it to be or expected, thought I'd make a few friends. None, zilch, I was passive but fuck me Always thought there was something wrong with me, How could I realize what was going wrong in my head. I was feeling lonely and I was just coping by my routine by going to school. The loneliness got so bad I Isolated myself only interacting with my family but I'd still go out with them so they just thought it was me being lazy. This was 2014-2017, years 2015 2018 were me doing shit all. Then 2019, went to gym to get in shape it helped for a bit and I got depressed again when I found out I had gynecomastia it didnt bother me before because I thought I just had to lose weight. It now pisses me off that I let something like that bother me(and still bother)... that I have this form of body dyphsmorphia but It must have to due to being bullied for being fat/heavy most of my childhood. I remember I thought I had social anxiety at one point and my therapist said it wasn't that as your talking to me completely fine. I've increased my confidence and speaking ability  but man I still feel lonely as fuck. The gym was just a band-aid and I never fixed the underlying issue. I've tried meet up groups and etc they always seem to fizzle out. I  Remember when I was little remembering to move into the city but I think it was just because everyone my age was there. I also went to hockey games by myself concerts (when I was 20). I've slowly became dejected.

Now fast forward 2020 we went on family trip to cuba before corona and travel always seems to lift my spirits. A natural anti-depressant so maybe I'll do that again when corona leaves...

When restrictions stopped here for bit, I went on date with someone we were texting for good few months with two video chats and it felt good. ( I know don't place your happiness on someone but I was isolated and she was interesting). Went on date was good she wasn't interested fair enough. But then i asked her to be friends because thats what I need more then a relationship  to be honest. but my abandonment issues got in the way as I asked her i wanted to be more then instagram friends or some weird ass shit(to a normal person with friends) ""something real""   and would like to meet her friends in short she got scared or something  didnt reply maybe I should of gave it more time but then I was like fine but later backtracked. Did most pathetic thing of asking to be friends still (even though im the one that ask, haha depression). It got bad and I feel like a dickhead especially now with all the stuff going on (never said nothing rude but i kept pestering her and she got rightfully mad) That was 6 months ago and I feel like a bad person still( with all thats going on makes me feel horrible, I hold my self to always do whats right and that wasnt right)

Tried with other people turned into flakiness or ghosting didnt sweat it learned from mistakes (I'm not selfish I known im not owned anything but loneliness gets to you.. I could only distract myself for so long)

Feeling lost in life so I'm just going to work on myself for now.When I write it down it makes me feel so stupid that it bothers me.

Just quit my job because I couldnt deal with the montony of just work home work home nothing to look forward to.  After 3 weeks downtime now I'm going to look for another one and go to back to school for something eventually.

I kind of hate what society has become, I wish mental health was taken more seriously so many of us wouldnt have to figure out things the painful way. imagine if i got help at 20 instead of 25. Oh well all i can do is move on and hope for the best Atleast I have my parents

Sorry this was in the spur of the moment  word vommit, writing it down makes me wonder why its even bothering me now or if i even want a friend anymore? what is a friend ? hell if I know?

27 now

m9u1pp,"As I grew older the clearer my future made sense. When I was 6 years old, I always thought I was gonna die of old age or accident or health issue. If I thought so deeply at such young age, I can only imagine how many millions of children might think similarly or even deeper thoughts.

I was still a very happy carefree child who enjoyed playing with other kids but at the same time I often stared at some of my childhood friends playing and thinking if they ever thought the same, we live and eventually die.

Now at 30, living with my partner of 6 years, my existential crisis became more and more permanent. I have this constant thought of having an X amount of years left to live or none at all at any minute.

I became such a serious person when I was a teenager, then as a young adult, I was a bit happier then serious again and now at 30, I have this serious looking face and persona that I can’t help  making. This life and death is engraved in my thoughts and I can’t forget it. I have tried to live with it, but it became me and I think that’s why I avoid making friends or talk with my family.

Fix what you can control, you can always get a great body. You can learn to dress better. Bet you can fix your teeth to some degree just go to the dentist. 

All of a sudden you are jacked, dress well, you teeth are better, and you can work hard to atleast make a lot of money. 

Some people are dealt a bad hand but I'm convinced that if anybody ACTUALLY tries they can be at least 6/10. And for a male, looks isn't all that matters if you wanna get laid. It's way worse being an ugly girl.

I knew she wanted me to kiss her, but i just couldn't get myself together to do it, she was the first girl i was ever interested in and i was to scared to fuck this up. After another few weeks she texted me that she doesn't want to hang out with me anymore, she said wants something more and I am crearly not interested in her. I was crushed, said some stupid shit to her, she blocked me everywhere. It's been 2 years and I'm still thinking about her, about her smile, the way she hugged me for goodbye's, the feel of her hand inside mines, her beautiful blueberry eyes, our trips to the zoo. I keep dreaming about how we got together again. It's making me crazy. I think that i will never find a girl like her. I would even kill myself if knew sure that it would just restart my life and i could see her for the first time again.",2021-03-21 15:58:06

It’s been 2 weeks and I feel so much better - I’m calmer, even my kids have noticed I’m not getting angry like I used to and my sister said she’s noticed I don’t obsess anymore.. I wish I started taking it earlier to be honest! My jaw gets sore at times and at the start I had the dry mouth but I just find life easier now. 
I do get tired though and wonder should I be on a higher dose than 50mg.. what makes people go up in their dose? Maybe this will just settle as I’m still in the early stages..

As a child i cried alot and never played like everyone else. I never really smiled or laughed, and never made any friends.
I eventually learned certain things were supposed to be funny, or laughing with someone was a “nice” thing to do, but it was never genuine.  


I’ve tried discussing my childhood with multiple therapists, but strangely they’ve been very dismissive and unhelpful.

I always enjoy sex when we have it. Today was the first time depression got in the way. I felt nothing. It was like I was numb. Then I asked him to stop and I was crying. And I couldnt really explain why. He was doing everything right, I just felt nothing. And now Ive been in bed crying because I just feel like he would be better off without me. 
Depression has ruined everything for me. Jobs, education, friendships, my figure, my hobbies...now it's going to ruin my relationship and my sex life which is the only thing Ive held on to.

m9tby6,"I’ve been feeling so good for the past few months. I just woke up from a terrible dream about my ex and I feel like I’m back to where I started. I know I moved on but I’ve noticed I get triggered with things that has associated memories of my ex. It’s just so shitty to feel like all the progress I’ve made and all the work I’ve put in is for nothing when I’m triggered. TLDR at end

A little back story. I was depressed throughout college but I was able to cope with friends, university resources, and deadlines didn’t really give me time to think about how I feel. After graduating last year, my ex broke up with me because we were long distance and there’s no way for it to work out. He found someone new 2 months later and he seems he really wants a future with her. It makes me feel like I wasn’t good enough. I was with him for 4 years and he never mentioned about me to his family and friends. Yet he did with her. I tried to tell myself I am good enough, I deserve someone better, and I’ve put so much work and effort to go out and meet people despite the conditions we live in right now. I’ve been doing so good, for the past few months I was so surprised to feel well, like wow is this what it’s like to not be depressed? I found a job, I moved to a new city, I made a couple new friends, I adopted a cat, I learned to take myself out for fun adventures, I started working out and eating better, I figured out how to fix and maintain my car by myself, I’ve gone on many dates and actually caught feelings for people. I’ve even started dealing with my other issues, like using alcohol to cope with anxiety and stress and I’ve gotten so much better at it. I felt like I’m growing and improving and making solid progress. 

Well, today I feel like I’m back to where I started. I’m just so disappointed. The dam that’s been holding back all those terrible thoughts came back. Why did I move to a city to instigate my fight or flight and now I’m lonely and sad at 2am? Why can’t I try harder to work out and eat better? Why can’t I try harder to self improve and get a professional license for my degree? Why can’t I keep my room cleaner? Why can’t I go to bed at a normal time like normal people? Why can’t I make myself do adult things instead of waiting till the last minute? And most importantly, why do I still get triggered by things that reminds me of my ex? Just in general why can’t I do better and try harder? I’m so disappointed in myself. I fear that I’ll never find someone that meets all my expectations and needs like my ex, because I feel like I’m not good enough to deserve it. Another reason is after all these attempts to go on dates, I’m more disappointed than ever. I don’t understand how it’s so hard to meet people that’s on the same wavelength as me. It makes me question that I’m doing something wrong and I’m just not trying hard enough. 

Right now I feel so alone, my friends that I can call and talk to are asleep in a different time zone. I don’t know if my insurance will cover therapy visits. I’m sad that I put myself in a position so vulnerable and I’m upset that I let myself get into this position. I’m hoping to find someone who’s going through similar things. Thanks for reading all this.  

TLDR/summary: I’m really disappointed in myself. I feel like I was doing well and turns out I’m not. I feel the same way I felt when I was depressed. I’m upset that all my efforts and work was for nothing. I feel like I’m just a shitty person who can’t achieve anything.

In my case it didn't work out because I am on benzos and only remember certain things we discussed.

m9t82j," Hi, I feel like I am at a rollercoaster of emotions, I might have a few days or weeks of me being fine emotionally and maybe even more productive but, a random day will come and ill have this negative thought which will get stuck in my head and then expand to all of the previous times I felt sad and just keep going down from there.

After that a while I'll convince myself that I have to do something about this or I randomly cheer myself up and then the cycle continues. Im not stupid though, every thought I have I understand makes no sense, logically I know that thinking negatively all the time won’t get me anywhere but I can’t help it. As many times as I hear online people say you just gotta pick yourself back up, or keep trying and then it will get better or any other positive advice like that I can’t help to still think the same exact negative thoughts, like how I hate myself, my personality, how I can’t seem to succeed at anything because I still can’t find a job or stick to one thing long enough to be good at it.

The worst thing is that I am fortunate enough, to not live in poverty. I have a roof, food, and even entertainment (internet, tv, etc), My family is not rich by any means but we are average I would say which is a situation many people would kill for, so that’s when I start comparing the way I feel to other peoples situation and I feel even worse since compared to others it would seem I should be the happiest man alive. That is why I often don’t like to say I am depressed even though I do feel like am.

I know I need help, and my plan was once I get a stable job and move out I would dedicate a portion to a therapist to help me because I can’t seem to be able to do it myself, but I just keep procrastinating, I don’t work or study as much as I know I should. I feel like everything I try to do eventually makes everything worse. And my parents don’t really understand the severity or seriousness of it since I don’t show it, and the little I have talked about it with them, they don’t seem to respond very well about it (they don’t understand the importance of help, therapist, etc.), I know I could convince them to get me a therapist but I just don’t feel good doing it considering the lack of interest on their part (Im not blaming them, maybe its my fault I haven’t talked about it enough).

I’m sorry for the lack of continuity and bad writing, the main purpose of this post is to talk about it since I don’t have any friends and I don’t talk about this with anyone and to maybe get some advice.",2021-03-21 15:08:09

One of my shit traits is I literally do anything to please anyone, to make people like me, to make people want to stay, to want to be around me. Even when I try not too it still happens. 

And eventually I go over the top and people realise what a fucking potato I am.

And when I do actually get people, I either trust too much and they leave, or they hurt me somehow and I have to leave. 

I just want to be able to have friends and be social. I want to be able to reach out and get to know people without them thinking about how fucking weird I am, or how ugly I am.",2021-03-21 14:40:28

I know it has a lot to do with the fact I don't like myself. I have come to terms with what and who I am (mostly a bitch according to others - even though I am rather straight forward).  So unfortunately I can't help you other than saying: find a therapist who will help you to come to terms with yourself. Do it now rather than wait. I am starting this journey on Tuesday.

I had to work very hard on this as a teen/young adult, I saw myself as a horrible ugly fat monster, with no personality... took being locked in psych ward for me to réalise something that was a pattern in my life, I had never seen. 9one day the hospital psychiatrist pulls me into her office, and says we be never seen this, I started drawing one day, and everyone on the ward pulled tables and chairs around me and went and asked for their own art supplies, and we just all did our thing in silence and this repeated for the next week or so. She was like everyone calm and concentrated, is quite a vision and such a welcome sightNow it might not seem like much, attracting 10-15 mentally ill people like a moth to a flame! But I realised this had happened repeatedly in my life, I am a timid person and a good listener and people tend to flock to me. For a time, then move on. now I sat down to analyse this phenomenon, at first of course, I thought I’m just not interesting enough to keep people around, then I realised it always tended to be a group of either misfits or people dealing with some kind of pain, and what I offered was my time and ear/and once they had gotten what they needed, they felt safe to move on, and that made me almost feel like I had a super power. Now living with depression, I sometimes still see that monster, but my issues are more about my mental state instead of my physical appearance.

Even alcohol helped but I can't stay drunk all the time(live with my parents). Self loathing has become my constant. And yeah I feel like a few more years of this shit, I'll probably just commit suicide. There is nothing good about my life. I have confidence issues. Like some legit serious confidence issues. I don't have a career or a future or a life tbh. Every time I fall in love with someone, I fuck up things, I overthink stuff and then I'm just left stranded. I can't focus on things. I'm v bad at communicating stuff. Never able to convey the thing I want to convey and end up making people mad. I tried an online paid therapy session cause I did not feel like going to a therapist. I expected him to give me some meds for these things so I don't have to depend on caffeine pills, energy drinks or alcohol, but he said I have to meet a psychiatrist in person because I have a case of substance abuse.🤷 So yeah basically nothing is working out for me.",2021-03-21 14:03:26
m9sate,"Preface to say I do this to myself honestly. 

My sleep schedule is practically nonexistent at this point. I’ve gone to sleep in the ball park range of 4-5am these past couple of days, waking up around 12pm-1:30pm. It’s not good for myself. But sometimes it doesn’t feel as broken? 

Hear me out. What do I even desire to see during the day? I barely see use in my college credits anymore other than the fact that I am indebted to a degree. My professors do the absolute bare minimum on their part. They sloth at their zoom meetings. They take our attendance grade, and then they give us mountains of work. They give us work, and then they give us these resources. I am 18,000 dollars in debt so far, all so I can sit at a computer and do shit for work. But hey! It’s a degree! Am I truly worth this much? Maybe so. 

Life at home is such a drama. My father has been nothing short of a child. And that’s very easy for a teenager to say. Every teenager hates their father. I mean this when I say this, my biggest fear is to become him. Leaving his entire life at home behind for some mistress who makes him feel powerful. Gaslighting my mother into believing she’s a terrible person, my mother who had done nothing more but try to save their marriage. But hey, he’s gone now. There’s his financial security. He hasn’t even divorced mom because he’s such a greedy asshole who doesn’t want to pay child support. He’s investing what could be helpful to my college, my brother’s future, food on the table, etc into the fucking STOCK MARKET for his own personal gain. That’s just the tip of the ice berg. He makes me so angry. 

I absolutely hate life during the day. I hate it. I have to deal with my own dumbass dads effect on this family, I have to deal with my stupid mistake to go to college, I have to deal with validation issues of my own wondering if I did something wrong. I have no friends to talk to practically. I have online friends sure, that’s something. They’re good people. But it’s not the same. It’s just not. There’s nothing physical. I like being physical. I’m stuck at home trying to avoid dying from a global pandemic that my own state has decided isn’t that big an issue because our gove(r)nor is an idiot. I can’t even leave home for the risk of my giving my grandmother the virus. She’s one of the very few things in this world that make me happy. 

Nighttime is the only time I have a little bit of control. I can do what I want. I can read. I can listen to music. I can play some games. I can browse the internet. I can distract myself from life. I hate my life. Eventually when I fall asleep tonight, I will be zen for the few hours which my brain turns off. I can only hope that I won’t dream.",2021-03-21 14:01:40

m9rr9k,"I don't seem depressed on the surface, I have a good mask in place. I've considered trying to reach out to people but every time a little voice in the back of my head says, ""they have their own problems, they don't need to worry about you too"" so I end up being quiet, so quiet that you might forget I'm even in the room. So I don't reach out, but I have considered it so much. Instead I choose to drown myself in fantasy worlds and drawing to escape it. 

I got put on antidepressants last November because I cried in front of my mom twice in two days... I hinted so much to my parents that something was wrong with me over the years but I'd get brushed off, ""everyone feels sad sometimes!"" And it took me, not crying in my room by myself, silent, for once, for them to notice. Every comment made me want to keep it to myself more and more. Bottling things up is habit. 

I think part of the issue is that I've been depressed from such a young age that I wasn't able to identify it as depression and neither were my parents. I was predisposed to it from a gene standpoint, and I have a chronic congenital illness which has a high rate of depression following. 

I've probably been depressed since my earliest recollections of memories. But, ""it's just hormones!"" Sure. Right. 

There were signs. In middle school I completely isolated myself, I didn't have friends, I told myself I didn't need one. I was emotionally numb to the point where my mother yelled at me for being too calm. But I just couldn't bring myself to care at all. I wasn't even aware of the concept of depression being applicable to me until my freshman year in college, when I got put on meds. I thought it was normal for people's minds to go through periods of feeling nothingness and an overwhelming numbness to everything and an indifference to their well being.

It was a dangerous state of nothingness. And with all that's happening in the world it's coming back, I just got out of there. I don't want to go back. 

The numbness to emotions means I've never experienced a meaningful relationship with someone because anytime I get too close to someone childhood trauma spikes and suddenly any and all feelings feel like I'm undeserving of them and I unconciously distance myself. (Maltreatment by pediatric doctors who unfortunately would rather restrain and force medical procedures on you then talk you down.)

And my sister passed away in 2019. A 16 year old watching her older sister succumb to illness. Even if it was her time and she's in less pain then she would be if she were alive, I still miss her. Everytime I think about her I become an emotional mess and fall deeper into the void. 

I genuinely don't know anymore. I just want to feel like I belong somewhere, I want to feel something other then the overwhelming void. I want someone outside of my family to tell me that I'm not a bother, that they appreciate my existance, that I'm pretty, anything. I crave physical affection and yet my brain tells me I'm selfish for asking it of others. Trauma causes me to avoid it further. Did you know as humans we're supposed to get at least 8 hugs a day for mental maintenance?

Anyways this was spurred by an episode of me feeling like Im trapped in a void of nothingness and everything at the same time. 12 different tabs open in my brain and none of them are loading and they're all jumbled out of order error 404 pages. Oh and hugs, I want a hug.

If you read to the end, thank you. I just needed to put this somewhere, anywhere. I don't want to add more heartache into my friends and family so Ive bottled everything up.

Anyways, much love, I hope you anonymous strangers are having a lovely day.",2021-03-21 13:23:55

I have good friends, hobbies that I have worked hard on, a first class degree from my country’s top university, a high paying job and a happy relationship. I take care of myself, look good and everyone comments how “I’ve got my shit together” and say they look up to me. 

For the last 5 years I have always had this overwhelming, unyielding emptiness and loneliness, and honestly feel like I’m coasting through life day by day. I seem happy and productive, but I’m sad probably 6 days of the week and since 16 I’ve only really had a few weeks where these feelings have cleared up and allowed me to feel something. Some times are worse than others where I won’t clean my house or get out of bed all day, but for the most part I keep up appearances and routines. 

It feels like life has no purpose. I struggle to find the joy in anything, even happy moments like holidays or spending time with my partner, friends and family. I’m not about to top myself but I’ve found comfort in the idea that I could just end this misery whenever I want. 

Because I look fine nobody would really take this seriously. I’ve been to psychologists with it for years and have been given a bunch of medications, but at the end of the day this is incredibly lonely and I feel as though I’m doing the bare minimum to get through each day for no apparent reason until I die sometime.

But yes, it feels very hollow sometimes, and I can’t say for sure what I’m missing. I have a few ideas on a purpose or a reason why I’m here, but none feel exactly right tbh. Still, I’m hopeful that as long as I keep moving forwards, I’ll find something. I hope you can too.",2021-03-21 14:04:48

Inside, I’m dying. I feel like a plant that’s slowly withering away because it gets the bare minimum sunlight. I struggle so hard but I’m so accustomed to saying that everything is great that I don’t know how to truly tell someone that I’m worse than I’ve ever been. 

And I have told people that. But I guess because my mask is perfected, when I tell them that they write me off. I mean, I say that and the following days I’m all smiles. Must have just been a down moment, right? 

But it wasn’t. That’s how I feel all of the time but I’m human and I put on my mask again and that’s all there is to it. I’m on auto pilot - doing what needs to be done for my kids, doing what needs to be done for my partner/husband-not-husband. If I was single without kids? Sure. I’d sell my house. I’d rent an apartment. I’d live at my sister’s, hell I would attempt to sleep on the streets. I don’t care. I just want to stop feeling numb, I want to actually be positive and excited about life.

I'm 31, married w/ kids, overweight, smoker. I hate just about every aspect of myself. I've tried working out multiple times to try and get healthy with no avail. I can't hold down a job for anything. My health is slipping because of my depression, but its also fueling the depression as well. I play video games to distract myself and get out of my own head, but at times even that doesn't work and I just sit doing nothing or say screw it and go back to bed. 

I've tried getting help in the small town I live in here in the states, but its blatant the doctors don't care. Plus with the cost we just can't afford it. I've started trying to get some of my health issues back in order starting with dental, but even then I probably have enough issues with that alone that we'll end up going bankrupt. We bought tickets to go visit my parents on the east coast this summer, who I haven't seen in 2-3 years and at times I just think I don't even want to go because I know I'm just going to be humiliated at the airport and feel even worse about myself.

I just have no motivation for anything anymore. Thoughts of being a horrible husband/parent/person, they'd be better off without me, ect have been coming more often. I read an anonymous quote in a social game lately that I felt sums up my feeling ""I don't want to die, I just want to stop feeling this bad all the time."" 

I'm tired of feeling like this. Tired of being a disappointment to my family and having no friends. Tired of the wanting to stay in bed all day and the hardly sleeping at all. Tired of all the negative feelings and emotions that bombard me day in and day out. I want help, but I don't know what to do.

He wasn't understanding (he never took the time to learn about depression, he thinks it was just me being sad and he called me things that made me feel even worse about something that is really hard for me to control)  and i feel bad that i have put him through what i did. He doesn't deserve that. No one does. 
Yesterday i was so depressed and anxious and i messaged him asking for another chance. He didn't answer for hours and when he did he said he needed to think about it. I have not heard anything since then. 
I don't know if messaging him was the best choice. I don't want to cause any more trouble to him. I love him, but i don't know if trying again is even worth it. I feel lost. I've had many great experiences with him, but my depression and insecurities are things he doesn't understand and hasn't really tried to. I don't plan on messaging him again. If he doesn't answer by tomorrow i will in my mind take it as a no and try my best to move on. It's just really hard.

I was in the covid ward and I spent so much time just thinking... My greatest pains were that I had 3 exs that knew me better than me. The 2nd I should have ignored my parents and moved in with her. She was totally the one. It was a long distance relationship at times when I was in college and she would know if I was suddenly super depressed.. She would drive 3 hours just to come spend time with me. I never even acknowledged how much she cared for me. 

Now I'm just depressed and crying now I fucked up these relationships. I've been in plenty of other relationships and none have competed with them. 

I'm not suicidal but I now wish that covid had taken me so I could just move on. None on these 3 will ever talk to me again. I just want to prove that I'm not that person and just be friends... But they just block me on Facebook. Dammit covid you should have finished me off. They probably wouldn't even have noticed. 

I actually wish the devil would show up and ask for my soul in trade to actually talk to these 3 wonderful women that were once the most important part of my life.

Omg I'm blabbering again. I'm sorry. I needed a vent. I'm literally just so alone. No friends. Just parents even tho I don't live with them... My mom is here because I fractured my spine at the start of this year and now recently covid ward. I hate 2021.",2021-03-21 12:00:20

There’s not much places to be social anyways. I just want a girlfriend but as the years go on I worry I’m too late. I wasted my college years doing nothing and have nothing to show for it.

groimzc,"Man if you're a loser I must be an utter failure. I've never been in a relationship, the only friend I've made since graduating high school completely stopped interacting with me when she got a boyfriend. I only started post secondary three years ago because I was convinced that I was useless. The only people I talk with are two of my siblings who only talk with me out of necessity and don't even like me. The rest of my family of 8 have disowned me and I have no idea where any of them are or do or even look like. I'm 26 and I'm covered in self harm scars and have 6 suicide attempts under my belt, only 1 of which ended up in hospitalization because I'm too good at pretending like everything is ok, even when my skin had to be sewn back together.

Like, dude you aren't doing bad at all. It's hard when it feels like everyone is so much more successful than you, but in the end that doesn't matter. Your life is yours, it has nothing to do with everyone else, its not a race, there's no competition. Our society has changed so quickly that norms haven't been able to catch up; a lot of things that deem a person as successful just aren't realistic to most people. It's ok to do things at a different pace, its ok to take some time alone to figure out yourself. It's ok to be worried and afraid, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter when or how or what you do with your life. It just matters that it's yours.

I know this sounds like ""chin up, you can do it"" kind of mentality but I promise it's not. You just have so much god damn life to live and it's hard that society is telling us that we're nothing if we don't follow the status quo right away. You're doing things at your pace, not someone else's, and you shouldn't be suffering for that.

Idk. This probably isn't helpful but, really, truly, you are doing fine. The world is so big and possibilities are endless. Your timing isn't off. You're good.",2021-03-21 13:17:23

m9q6om,"so i grew up in the city, but halfway through highschool i moved 3 hours up north to where my home reserve is, and it's tiny. the two connected ""towns"" i live in in combination with some of the surrounding areas barely has 13000, the nearest ""city"" is an hour away with 20000 people and it's really just the largest settlement in the area and thus has been dubbed a city. moving here mid-highschool didn't give me a great chance to make friends so i do not have any friends within a 3 hour radius of my house and the only friend i had in the city isn't much of a friend to me which leaves my uni friend(s?) at 6 hours away.

now it's not the fact that i don't have any friends in my area, i love it up here and i very much enjoy the fact that i don't have people bothering me up here, i do not like the white people in this area (they're Quite racist as this area is considered a hick town) and i do like having time to myself from people i would not have willingly chosen to be friends with if we didn't go to the same very tiny highschool and had somewhat overlapping interests.

i started university last year and i made two groups of friends, one of which i broke off due to the racism and the other i'm still close with. i became really good friends with the person who introduced me to the group i'm still close with and we started dating around this time last year. all this is great, my relationship is great, everything is peachy! thing is, my partner lives in a house with 6 of my friends, 2 of which are in the og group and the other 4 have been through my visits to their household. they were all in a club together and decided to all go in on a house together which is sweet and really great, but i really can't help but feel terribly left out. my partners house has dnd nights, movie marathons, dinners with each other, grocery shopping together, study groups, and one of the roommates even got their partner to move in with him about 2 months ago, and even though i'm friends with all of them and i have been just as close with the 3 that i knew prior to them getting a house together, i feel so excluded and my isolation from living at home is only heightened because of it since i had to go and stay home during winter break due to covid. the og group is alright but i'm not really friends with them, besides my partner, none of them are people i would actually be friends with outside of our study/friend group.

now i KNOW i'm not apart of their household but i'm just as much of a friend to them than they are with each other which is why i feel so awful when they do totally normal roommate stuff that u need a group of friends to do with and i'm not included. this household has a group chat of all them and their extended friends of which i am apart of and i was over one time while they were talking about it and i mentioned twice while there was complete silence in the room if i could join and i was entirely ignored. i have been going to their dnd sessions from even before they split off from their main group and started their own but i never played because i simply came along with my partner and observed bc i didn't really have anything better do to and i've brought it up multiple times and it's been disregarded.

it's not even that serious and they aren't even doing it on purpose but this makes me have some sort of mental breakdown at least 3 times a week because i don't know how to cope with this because my mind is telling me that they have to not like me if they include the other roommates partner who's got the same relationship with everyone there as i do and that person moved in and is included and i'm not! i don't know what other explanation there would be to it other than them not liking me and only putting up with me because i wasn't allowed guests at my place so i only visited my partners place (the partner that moved in had a place too btw, nearly identical situation, my place sucks, their place sucks, i don't get it) so bc of that i feel that they only put up w me bc of my partner and this just feels even worse and every day i spiral more and more and honestly it's scaring me a bit to the point in what if i don't live long enough to see my partner again in september? but at the same time, i don't want to join the dnd group or be included for movies because 1. they're gonna do it without me anyway 2. i feel like i'd be intruding and 3. if i asked them they'd probably say yes but only out of pity for me or bc of my partner because i have gotten confirmation that at least half of them do not like me at all

i really don't know what to do or think about this and i don't have anyone else i can talk to about it. nothing online can help either because nobody is really in the same situation as me, this isn't even covid isolation because it would be like this anyway. i'm also really scared because i've told my partner about some of this but i'm really afraid that if i keep going on this depressive spiral that's CAUSED by their household, they won't want to be with me and then i'm really gonna have exactly zero friends, absolutely NOBODY! no contacts, no acquaintances, no work buddies, just me, and i don't know how i would ever deal with that and i know it's so super toxic and Not good but i do not think that i would last long if that happened. i know the solution is to get more friends but HOW? i have had exactly two friends that i have gotten close enough to to hang out outside of school or clubs in my entire life. 2. and with covid, how the HELL am i supposed to magically find a friend i can emotionally rely on?? i don't know what to do. i suppose there's nothing i can do about it but how do i cope is the question? everyone else i know has their own friend group separate from me that they are closer to than the one with me in it and god i just feel awful i feel sick to me stomach about it i can't even DO anything about it without other people only saying yes out of pity or just the fact that they can't say no, and honestly that's worse than if they outright denied my requests for social interaction. i've asked the og group for a dnd group bc one mentioned starting a campaign and doing group calls but it's been a year and a half with constant reminders and nothing has come from it, so i have since left the og group chat for peace of mind (just bc seeing the gc icon would make me feel awful, like a constant reminder that i'm not good enough or something). i have started to distance myself from those who are only apart of this issue and overall, i can't say it's better or worse but it's better than being in a gc with your partner and friends who all live in a house together who all have a niche interest of which they've made a channel for (i was included, but since i've been home they've been watching the show without me) while you live alone with only your family out in the middle of nowhere with only a partner who texts you about 3 texts a day due to other people to talk to and school. i will not be proofreading this i am so sorry if this makes exactly zero sense, i don't expect anyone to read nor respond so idrc lol i just needed to get my grievances out.",2021-03-21 11:53:53

m9ptyz,"I have never in my life been popular anywhere, and the last place I would ever be is rn at high school. And up until sometime last year I didn't really care about what the people around me did since I always saw them as people who won't affect my life at all, yet a few days ago I have been actually told of what these people act and do without me. And not gonna lie, it sounds really fun, but the reputation I earned of basically being the social pariah of the class doesn't help me at all. 

All of these years of surrounding myself with people who actually do care for me feel like nothing compared to the feelings of wanting to be loved by everyone who has never given a shit about me or even hate me. 

So my question is, why do I care so much ? Why does it matter for me what people who never wanted to do anything with me think about the life I lead ?

m9ptvj,"cw: mention of self harm and suicide

I have everything I could possibly ask for and more. I am 20. I go to one of the most prestigious universities in the world with complete financial aid. I have substantial savings and no debt. I'm living with family because of COVID so I don't have many expenses at the moment. I'm going to enter a very lucrative field upon graduating and I have an amazing internship this summer. I'm at a healthy weight with an okay body without having to work very hard at it. I have an awesome, wonderful, sweet, kind, smart, funny, responsible, honest, loyal, adoring, handsome SO. If you told me five years ago that this is where I would end up, I would be so excited. Things really did work themselves out after all.

Except they didn't, and I'm miserable. I have everything and I'm still terrible. I hate myself. I've cut people off or been horrible to them many times and only realized after the fact that I'm far worse than the people I felt entitled to disrespect. I thought I had become a better person and learned from these experiences after a while. I thought that after acting so reprehensibly, I had changed. That wasn't the case. I was just getting my way. When I stopped getting my way I went right back to being blunt, rude, demanding, and unpleasant.  All the pain, therapy, pills, and traumatic experiences with psychiatrists were for nothing. I just keep hurting people and myself. I am the problem. I am bad.

When you google ""I hate myself,"" the results that pop up are hotlines and articles about how mental illness warps your thinking and makes perfectly good people think they're the scum of the earth. Well guess what? I am actually awful and I have examples to back it up. I'm disgusted with and ashamed of myself. No one writes guides for actually bad people to feel better because we don't deserve that. We're better off dead, so no one has to deal with us. 

I know my boyfriend deserves so much better than me. He tells me I make him so happy but I know I'm getting worse and worse, and treating him worse as well. I wish he would meet someone new, someone as wonderful as he is, who won't lash out when they're angry or bring him down when they're sad, someone who didn't cover their body in scars and try to cut their arm open in front of him. I wish I could see him move on to someone better and then off myself, removed from his life so I can't hurt him any further.

He has anxiety. He gets very upset when I say that I'm ok but I'm clearly not. I'm still lying to him about it. I can't bring myself to complain to him. I'm not even helping myself. I'm pushing myself down further. Dumping my problems on him won't improve anything but it'll make him feel worse and he doesn't deserve that. 

I tried to kill myself last December. I wish I had. I couldn't handle the pain because I'm weak and can't tolerate anything that I don't like. I wish I had, though. I wish I were long since dead. I wish I were nothing but a box of ashes. And once all the people who care about me die or get driven away, I will become just that.",2021-03-21 11:30:24

gromn7u,"He obviously still loves you after all of this, does he not? If he's as amazing as you describe, and really deserves much better, why is he still with you? Why does he still say you make him happy? Why does he still care so much for you?

I don't mean to say you don't have any problems --- we all have faults, and we all need to work on being better versions of ourselves --- but reading the way you talk about yourself makes me really doubt you are as bad as you describe. Few people are. Would you talk about the way you talk about yourself to another person? What would you say if you heard someone talking about your boyfriend like the way you talk about yourself?

I used to think I was an awful person. Maybe I still do, in some way. Eventually, though, you realize that the way you're talking about yourself just can't be entirely true. I'm a very forgiving person --- I know folks who have done some pretty awful things to me. I would still never talk about them the way I talk about myself. It would just be an awful thing to do.

But God do I know that there is no way any of us are as awful as we make ourselves out to be. It's just a statistical improbability.

You obviously care so, so much for him. It may present itself in a very self destructive way, but you are able to recognize the ways you might be hurting him. You realize how much he means to you. That is a lot. That is so much. That alone convinces me you're not horrible. 

I don't know you. You don't know me. None of us know anyone else here, really. So I obviously can't definitively say anything about the situation you're in. But, just from the way you talk about yourself, it reminds me of the way the people I know talk about themselves and how unbelievably untrue it all is.

This was [my previous post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzle6o/if_you_knew_me_irl_youd_never_know_how_much_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) for context. 

This isn’t also to say I don’t have depression, anxiety, or adhd. It’s that I’ve also been traumatized AF  and omfg I have some form of dissociation disorder. My years of depression, anxiety, and adhd were also years filled with unbearable trauma from a very early age.

It’s like a lightbulb has gone off but it’s also a lot. I’m it’s coming very fast and I’m trying to learn exercises from my therapist to contain the trauma for the right time. Also working on listening and feeling and understanding my body. Making the connections of my feelings to my body. 

Part of what I felt so desperate before was because I thought there wasn’t anything new. I already knew all the things and just couldn’t do the work. Trauma research is becoming more known. I think if we knew now what we know about trauma when I was a kid, a different approach would’ve been taken. 

And the important thing is that it’s your trauma, doesn’t matter if “it wasn’t bad enough”. Your body doesn’t know the difference. I felt like all of this info was hidden to me and I’m glad that I found a trauma evidence based therapist.",2021-03-21 11:29:14
m9pt2n,"I can't blame it *entirely* on the MDD because like, I think I still wouldn't have taken care of myself that well even if I wasn't depressed, but it definitely exacerbated shit.

I dropped everything and isolated myself when I was at my worst. I stopped eating and did nothing but stay on my phone and listen to music all the time. Also stopped drinking water and literally only drank coffee for a while. Lost 43 pounds in two months, it was *that* bad.

That was late 2017. I got better for a bit but still never fully got back to 100% my old self. Kept a lot of the old bad habits. Never got back to ""living"" so much as just floating along and getting by.

So *now*, I'm having heart problems. I get palpitations and my heart beats harder whenever I move or even feel any sort of strong emotion. My limbs buzz a lot and I get dizzy when I walk around. I also have tinnitus from all the music blasting so I get to listen to a high-pitched whistle *at best* all the time.

I'm not even depressed in a way where I feel apathetic towards it. I'm enraged and remorseful and crying at how bad I let it get and seeing all the time I wasted and all of this irreversible damage. I almost *want* to feel apathetic again right now because I'm flooded with guilt, like I failed. I want to live a normal life again but I just feel hopeless with the stupid heart palpitations, with the noise of what sounds like a helicopter landing in my head if I accidentally listen to *any noise* for too long.

m9prgo,"My depression been better than ok lately, but tonight it really hit me, I looked at the accounts of my old classmates and they're doing so much better than me, I do admit that I stalk their social media accounts more than I would like to admit. I feel so worthless, I've noticed that I catch myself on the thought that I'm not enough somehow as a human, and never be, my life is practically worthless, I honestly just want to die, it feels like I can't live in a world with people that worth a lot more than me. Before I always heard people say that they feel not enough, I never really understood what they meant, but recently the realization really did hit me a couple of times, I think I understand now. 

My life's been really always fucked up even my childhood, I'm not American, I lived and moved countries and seen a lot more than an average American, but despite all that I still feel so worthless, it's like I know that it's an established fact that I'm really not deserving of life or living, I thought about this so much it really rarely brings me pain or concern, it's literally just a fact for me, but on occasion something hits and I just go off crying and feeling emotional pain. 

The things that trigger me are very random and stupid, for instance, I'm writing this after I cried for an hour after I found out that a sister of my former classmate who used to bully me was accepted to a good university. How fucking more stupid the trigger can be, but here I'm reminding myself that my life is worthless. It's not just stupid triggers like that that get to me though. Sometimes the worthlessness just pops up in my head and it's like this feeling of emotional sting, or being emotionally electrocuted. 

I never had any friends in my life, I literally never had them, I'm not talking in metaphorical sense, I never had a friend, I don't exactly understand how though, maybe for people it's obvious but like I'm clueless. Literally since childhood I remember wondering about death and what's it like for people to die, it's always been creepy to me and still is, but it's just this feeling of wonder about what are those dead seeing and hearing that we cannot, a lot of my relatives died, I attended a lot of funerals as a child, I lived in a small village in central Asia, and everyone always said that they're in a better place. As a child though I never realized that there's such thing as trauma, depression, or anxiety, I've been just living, maybe not much happily but as a child I just accepted everything and moved on, I was so strong I feel like, I really wish I had a mindset like that right now. It's really the past 10 years that I began realizing how fucked up my situation is, and everything just boiled over and it feels like I have emotional bruises from everything that had boiled over. And when I'm crying I'm always thinking about how much I've had experienced in my life time, I will never be truly understood by anybody, it's really painful to think of this for some reason,   people would never understand how much pain there is, or even that kind of pain. 

I feel like I'm stuck in this American living, I really wish I never moved here, not really blaming, it just seems like fait, I really wish I could've moved somewhere forever, to get away from everything that reminds me everyday, but honestly those reminders are everywhere. I really think the dead are in far better place, even if there's no such thing as place at all. I know for a fact that I will never kill myself, I just know it, I'm not sure why I'm so sure about it, there's really no hope, but I just wouldn't be able to that's all I know.",2021-03-21 11:25:42

She was very surprised when I said I'd buy her one. I don't know her and I've never talked to her before and I might it again. Do you think it's selfish that I get happiness from helping others. I'm not trying to look for praise, I'm just very numb these days to understand anything. Mg gf cheated on me last week so that's made me feel even worse. I always liked helping others, I sometimes wish I could do more but maybe I'm just self absorbed. Sorry if I'm bothering anyone here. I just don't know where else to say anything.",2021-03-21 11:05:55
m9pd5l,"I keep lashing out on my parents. I keep getting more and more distant from them. I feel so fucking bad. My mom just cried in front of me about it. I already suspect I have depression and I'm only 14. I can't tell my parents about this so I can get a diagnosis. My parents (mom especially) get super stressed over my grades. I'm not the best student, all C's and F's. She says I'm a failure, that she never had grades this low when she was younger. She's not wrong about me being a failure.

I can't tell them about my ""depression"" because I don't want to stress them out. My mom already has high blood pressure and cannot handle stress without feeling sick. My dad has cancer (he's thankfully recovering from it) but still is weak. I don't even know if this is real. I feel like I'm faking it. I feel like it's a fucking placebo. I want to overdose but too scared what's after death or I might regret it. My mom would literally jump off a bridge if something like that happened. I don't know why I'm feeling like this. I feel like I'm just being ""edgy"". I've had this problem since the day I turned 13. I feel like it's not powerful enough for it to be true depression. I was reading a book for English class the other day. The book was called ""A Child Called It"", and it's about a child who was physically, emotionally, verbally, etc abused by his parents (mostly by his mother). Now, my mother is not that abusive, obviously. But one of the pages talked about how the main character hugged a school nurse and he wanted to cry because she felt so warm. Holy fuck, I relate to that so much. I want to hug an older lady, but not my mom for some reason. It's not even a sexual thing, I just want a lady to hug me and tell me it's alright and never let go. I just shed a tear writing that. I'm a pathetic human being. Sometimes I think about how I would feel if my mom got ran over by a car or got a heart attack or something.

How would I react if she died? Well, I always feel numb about it. It's like I don't even care about my own biological mother anymore. In fact, I don't know how I would feel if any of my other family or friends died. I'm so fucked up.

grocwid,"I don't have a lot of advice for you, but I can tell you this: you're not faking it. You're not being ""edgy."" Wanting to die is not a thing that mentally healthy people regularly experience. That is all the reason you need to justify getting help. Experiencing pain that you're struggling to cope with is all the reason you need to justify getting help.

I was twelve when it started and I felt the exact same way. I was so ashamed, especially as a girl, because I thought that teen girls are just dramatic and cringey. Surprise: I was not, and even if I were it still would have been so much better if I'd gotten help. 

I didn't get it, though. I thought that if I were well enough to ask for help I must be fine. That was not correct and it has cost me for the better part of ten years. 

Tell your parents you want to go to therapy. You don't have to tell them everything if you don't want to--just that you're struggling and unhappy with where you are and you think having a therapist might help you. You can be okay. You're not going to hurt your parents by asking for help.",2021-03-21 11:50:34

The point is that you need to talk to your mum but because you can't do it alone you need someone who helps you with it.  

Can understand that you feel alone though,  that is also the depression. I am not in the US so don't know enough about the dynamics there. 
You need to find someone you both can trust who is impartial. Is there a youth centre in your area? Are you regular church goers? What about a parent from your friends?

m9paim,"For years... For my (17M) entire life it's been hell. Constant harassment and so many psychological wars I'm so tired... I've been threatened, hit, verbally abused, and anytime someone in my family tries to help they in the end always get sick of me in a bad mood and end up pushing me down more. I want out of this god forsaken family that I call hell.

I've been: 
Threatened for the following: losing ability to see half sister, sent to a mental hospital, not be able to do the things I love, losing everything in my room (having everything gone except mattress), have the cops called on me (for defending step-sis), have cameras to monitor all of my moves, and other things I can remember while having my breakdown as of writing this.
Things I've been told my entire life: I am just ""lazy"", always a disappointment, never have any friends, always compared to cousins, never considering those around me, always thinking about myself, ""your not depressed, just a hormone thing"", ""Man up""

There's so much to explain. I'm sick of being with this family. No one cares enough about me and everytime I try and build trust with them they always break it down. I can't trust anyone in my family anymore. Everytime I happen to fuck up or do something mildly bad, everyone in my family is told and I am always ridiculed about whatever it was. Sure it may look like they care but in actuality they only care because the fucking law says they have to until 18. 
I've been used so many times by family to fuel their stupid fuckin manipulation wars, I've always been in the middle, and everytime I have to be in the middle because one of my siblings gets into trouble and I have to defend them. Because of this, I haven't seen my step-sis in over a few years. I greatly miss her everyday and it hurts so much to understand her struggle as well, and knowing I can't do anything.

It hurts so much. The pain of the past, knowing I can't do anything to fix it, and the pain of the present and future, as the threats and manipulation and not being able to see siblings, and being told I'm a failure almost everyday to an extent. The only person I feel who cares is my girlfriend, who I am so grateful to have in my life, because right now I feel as if she's the only thing keeping me from wanting to fucking die.
She knows what has happened in my life, and her family along with her are offering so much to me and I feel more loved by them than my own family. Even though we haven't dated for long I'm so happy to have her. But everyone keeps trying to take the things that make me happy away. 
I'm just about to fail school this marking period (I'm american, for context). I have 70s across the board and I've struggled so much with my mental health lately due to some of these events. I'm being threatened to have my girlfriend and her family be told about my failing grades and how I'm a failure. And all that's happening is my mental health is so unstable, and I'm always in pain so I it's hard to find motivation to do things, even if it's things I used to enjoy. I can't even see anyone about my mental health, no one will take me or I'm just ""not depressed, and it's ok to feel sad sometimes."" IF IT WAS JUST FROM TIME TO TIME THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE FELT THIS WAY SINCE 2015. 
I can't take this anymore. I've had suicidal thoughts almost everyday now and I feel so horrible and awful and like a disappointment to everyone, except my girlfriend. Everytime I'm happy, everyone tries to take it away. I need help so badly and I want to be seen for it, I want out so badly, please just someone GET ME OUT OF THIS PLACE CALLED HELL!
Everything I do is monitored and I can't escape, I need to leave I need to find a safe haven. Curse this stupid fucking system for children, no one in the law listens to teens or kids and they always side with the adult no matter how much they're been hurt.

I'm sorry about this long read. It's been so tough. And babe, if you are reading this, 
Please help me. Please get me out of this hell hole. I can't take it anymore I'll snap if I stay please get me out of here. Show it to your family, at this point I'm so desperate to get out of here I may as well run away.

(This isn't my main account, as my dad follows me on my main and I would probably be threatened with a mental hospital yet again.)",2021-03-21 10:54:24
