Then add weight to your exercises. Small amounts at first then more as you go. As this is a very mobile activity I suggest weight you can strap to your ankles, wrists, waist, back, and chest to evenly distribute said weight. 

Then practice. A lot. Day on. Day off. Day on. Day off. When you can jump as far as you can without weight add more weight. 

Pick a length of time 3 months say, and then test your jump without your weights.

gru4jt6,"This happened in a large hotel a couple of years ago in the west midlands, uk.

Myself and my partner were staying in a hotel for the evening whilst going to a gig at a local venue. We checked into the hotel and were given a room in the hotel basement. The room was on the right hand side of the corridor right next to a partition door. Everything appeared perfectly normal except for the lack of windows in the room due to its basement location. Both myself and my partner entered and exited the room a number of times that day as we had gone out shopping in the local town prior to attending the gig.

We left the hotel around 8pm and returned around 11pm. As we entered the front doors of the hotel there was nobody on the front desk and the area was quiet. We got into the lift and took it down to basement level. We then both instinctively walked to our right as we went through the partition door to enter our room we were met with a brick wall. We both gave each other a confused look and found that our hotel room door had now moved to the left of the partition door.

We have discussed this many times and do not feel that we misremembered the doors location. Neither of us had been drinking or taken any drugs that evening. The hotel room when we entered it was exactly the same as the one on the right with our possessions in the exact same places.",2021-03-22 23:28:42

She spoke some English, but when she confirmed that I spoke no Spanish (I do a little), she spoke non-stop into her phone (but I didn’t understand any of what she said, way too fast). When we arrived, two giant bodyguard-looking guys unloaded the car. One of them dropped a bag and looked scared when it happened. I thought I was going to be eliminated for knowing too much but I drove off. No tip, and no one believed my story until I used google maps and showed them the estate.

As I was already kind of terrible at existing as a person- having depression, got drunk a lot, had mild Asperger's, and a terrible home life- our friendship grew toxic and it was a lot of tit-for-tat asshole moments. But, my senior year of high school, I had told him a secret that had gotten out. I had assumed that he betrayed me and told everyone, but I was just bad at keeping secrets. So, in drunken revenge and assuming that his parents were as strict as mine, I had left some adult toys so that his parents would find them and blame him. Fortunately, he didn't get in trouble for them, but he did figure out it was me. After that, we never spoke again and I went off to college, where I am currently making myself a better person. I feel terrible about what I had done and now I am working on changing myself. I hope that I can fully apologize one day, but for now I just have to make myself a better person.",2021-03-22 23:29:47

My social modes are, generally speaking, based on the behaviors of other people. Some are amalgamations of people, some are *purely* based upon one person. This works for me as I've learned **most** of my social behaviors through emulation. Kinda what you have to do, really, when you have Asperger's-like issues with social cues.

My overall social mode is an amalgamation of other peoples behaviors with huge swaths inspired by one person(s). My protocols, within this mode, for greeting new people comes from a dear friend of mine. I hold myself with relaxed confidence, put on a cheerful smile, and then greet the person as if they're not a strange but instead merely a friend I do not *quite yet* know as well as I would like. 

This template helps put me at ease, as it is based upon a friend who I think is fairly successful socially. They never seem out of their element (which may just mean they hide the moments they are out of their element *really* well), they're always really friendly, they have a certain aura of confidence surrounding them due to a combination of body language and tone, and they're usually rather 'measured' in their responses. I'd say their approach works a good 90% of the time, as most people respond well to them. So knowing that the behaviors I emulated and tweaked to suit me work a good majority of the time, it puts me at ease to use them.",2021-03-22 23:32:08

I'm broke with no job so I would have to go through them for it. I know I could probably talk to them about it but my mom very much shrugs it off unintentionally thinking that saying nice things to me is the solution, and I'm scared to talk to my dad about it due to his past with suicide in the family.

One of his brothers killed himself before I was born and I don't want to put him through the thought of his own son ending up just like his brother. Sorry if this got to heavy for the thread but it was really the only thing I'm afraid to ask.",2021-03-22 23:29:42

2. If you're doing a baby registry, what you really want is diapers.  You don't need a bottle warmer, wipes warmer, or other other crap.  
3. Despite #2 above, get a MamaRoo4.  My son and daughter were fussy babies and it was a lifesaver sometimes.  
4. Bonding time is just as important for Dads as it is for Moms.  Your approach to baby tasks can dictate your relationship with your kids.  Change diapers, clean up snot, mop up after them, do bath duty and change their outfits all the time.  It's not just helping out your SO, it's valuable one-on-one time with your kids and they will remember it as they get older.  
5. Don't be scared if you feel ""nothing"" at first.  It takes time to fall in love with anyone, including a new baby.  
6. Don't forget your SO.  It's stressful for them too, and they need you more than ever, but differently than they did before.  Figure that out, and do the best you can with it.

Looking back at it, it was foolish.  Although I live in Florida, and it made national headlines of how it took forever for them to get their unemployment, I realize now that since I was cut back to part time I made less money than if I would have just accepted a layoff, despite having to wait, and I would have made more money in the end.

Well, at least I learned from my mistake, but in the end I don't regret it overall.

Now, I've probably not collected out of laziness/ethical reasons.  That requires some explanation.

I was part of a mass layoff in California, which required 60 days of pay.   For simplicity, let's say I got laid off on March 15th - they took my badge, computer, disable my accounts.  But they paid me until May 13 by California.  If I find a job before May 13, I lose my extra 4 months of severance.  So, I find an awesome job, and they want me on the May 1st or June 1st.  I chose June 1st to get my severance.

In theory...I think (I say ""think"" because I was too lazy to find out the law) I could have actually filed for unemployment if I looked for a job during May 13-May 31 - but I already knew I had a job in the June lined up, I basically got paid for 2 months to do nothing, I had a 4 month severance, and my new job got me a massive raise.

gru2sdj,"Ok, this is my dads story but I'm sharing. He's completely atheist and really dislikes organized religion but he believes in supernatural \*something\*

He's been a cyclist his entire life and in college would go on really long rides. Like 100+ miles. Which sounds crazy to me but I've never cycled so I don't know if that's normal for people who are amateur racers. 

Anyway, he was out one day in the boonies of Iowa, 1970s. He's out of food, he's many many miles from home, and he's thinking he's not going to make it back because he's feeling so weak and drained and like, about to pass out. There's no people around, no cars, no homes. He's trying to focus on just keeping himself pedaling, and all he can think about is Lays potato chips. A certain flavor, I can't remember. He's visualizing a full grocery sized bag of these Lays potato chips and thinking about them non stop. And a few minutes later, on the side of this dusty ass road, is a full, unopened bag of the exact chips he was visualizing. He stopped, ate them, and had enough energy to make it home.

Not spooky but I always loved when he told that story",2021-03-22 23:15:49

It causes me a great deal of anxiety to think about the current state of climate change, about how there's not much that can be done/is being done and we are running out of time.

In terms of what I have done, I've tried to do the little things, recycling, not throwing stuff away (or buying it in the first place), reducing carbon footprint, etc. Tbh I know it's not enough but I feel like it is inevitable that it will happen so to some extent what's the point.

I also think that men shouldn't be forced to be involved when the woman chooses to keep the baby, we shouldn't ruin people's lifes because of our decisions. Forcing someone to pay you child support is as cruel as forcing someone to get an abortion but in different ways.

We can know who our vulnerable people are and we can prepare for our relationship with hazard exposure to the point where disasters don't need to happen.

The word ""disaster"" often brings a sense of novelty and a false sense of timeliness- disasters don't just happen. They're the product of decades of risk management and mitigation agendas.

> Saudade is a deep emotional state of nostalgic or profound melancholic longing for an absent something or someone that one cares for and/or loves. Moreover, it often carries a repressed knowledge that the object of longing might never be had again. It is the recollection of feelings, experiences, places, or events that once brought excitement, pleasure, and well-being, which now trigger the senses and make one experience the pain of separation from those joyous sensations. However it acknowledges that to long for the past would detract from the excitement you feel towards the future. Saudade describes both happy and sad at the same time, which is most closely translated to the English saying ‘bitter sweet’.",2021-03-22 22:54:18

gru4ffb,"You're right on the scandal, but you seem to have an improper view of what a successful bioweapon is as well as the fine line a virus must tread to become a pandemic.

First, without modern medical intervention, COVID-19 would likely have a death rate of around 10%. Those that are hospitalized would generally die without getting into a hospital.

Second, if a virus is significantly deadlier than around 10-20% then it is very likely to kill off all hosts before it spreads very far. It needs to be extremely contagious and have a long asymptomatic period to get around that. HIV, for example, has an extremely high death rate, and is quite infectious, but it kills over the course of years to decades. 

But, the same things that make something a successful virus can make it a poor weapon. HIV would be effectively useless in war, because it doesn't take anyone out of combat any time soon, but it's effective. If a virus is extremely debilitating, and generally dangerous, then your side may fall victim to it, too.

About the most effective biological weapon ever used was smallpox, which was a bit of a perfect storm. It was extremely deadly, but only to a certain population. It could live on surfaces for a long period, and survived in another population with minimal negative consequences. So, the Europeans continuously reintroduced it to native americans almost every time they met (both on purpose and on accident). 

An effective weapon is one that disables an enemy's ability to wage war. Whether through economic damage or life lost, it doesn't really matter if it hinders defense or attack capabilities. As such, COVID did a pretty good job at harming everyone's ability to wage war, making it effective, but nearly no one was spared, so it wouldn't be an actual good weapon. It's too difficult to contain.",2021-03-22 23:27:49

They didn't respect one another, so they undermined each other constantly. *C o n s t a n t l y*. My mother shit talked my father to us, my father shit talked my mother to us. They overruled each other's decisions, etc, etc.

They didn't, at all, work together well. They compromised, *sure*, but that was normally one of them *giving in* to the other. It was a battle of wills and there could only be one victor. They sucked ass at actually *working together* to solve a problem so the solution was favorable for both of them.

And, lastly, their love was a thin-veil that hid how much they despised one another. That or they self-gaslight themselves to think they loved each other when, really, they didn't. At the very least, that was what my mother did. And, well, kinda hard for a marriage to work if you hate your spouse.

I've seen and heard family members complain that ""those black people"" are burning down entire cities and that they're all ""just like that.""

I have friends who were harassed by police officers (white males) for ""suspicious activity."" They were sitting in their car, at the park, talking. They were accused of possessing drugs, falsely. They are, surprise, POC.

I've seen someone's ""sweet old lovable grandma"" go on a tirade about ""Fucking Gooks not knowing how to drive for Christsakes!""

I've heard people complain, louldly and in public, that ""Towel Heads all deserve a bullet to the dome.""

I've seen a gaggle of hillbilly, white ass motherfuckers surround and threaten a Native American man at a strip club, all because they (hillbilly squad) were complaining about ""Damn injuns get free handouts 24/7"" and the young man asked if they'd like to live off those programs programs real or just complain.

gru307t,"Therapy helped me to talk through everything and ""desensitise"" myself to it all. 

But also, and I'm not saying this is healthy in the fucking *slightest*, but my ED became almost a lifeline for me.

In a very fucked up sense of way, I was regaining the control over my body that I once lost at the hands of my ex, who also abused me both emotionally and physically. 

I'm trying to recover from it, as I realise it's severely unhealthy and it's holding me back from so so much... But it's just as difficult.

However, as I said, it became this weird fucked up coping mechanism to deal with what happened to me, as the abuse went on for the two years that we were together and I was raped on top of that. Then when I brought it up to him the morning after, he seemed almost *offended* that I would even *dare* accuse the almighty man of such abhorrent things! Then he made it my problem all day so I was forced to repress the memory and stay silent. 

So in an equally fucked up way, without it, I would've succumbed to my suicidal thoughts.

3) Be intentional about getting to know each other - interest and conversation need to be two-sided. Rather than your folks just trying to learn about your likes and dislikes and those things make an effort to learn about them and appreciate them. 

The moral is a balanced investment and participation in each other's lives that demonstrates the love and appreciation of both parties. Make little traditional activities you do regularly that you look forward to. These are just some ideas.

gru1kbp,"In Canada. 

I got furloughed in March of last year. My boss sent my Record of Employment to Service Canada on my last day. I applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit aka CERB on my last day of work as well.

A few weeks later they began sending me $1000 every two weeks including a small backpay to cover the few weeks it took them to process my application. These payments went towards rent, utilities, and groceries, and two video games to use for quarantine entertainment. Never had to buy gas for the car since we never went anywhere, and everything else went into savings. Every two weeks I would submit my report to Service Canada meaning I tell them I want to and can work but have found no job and they continued to send me CERB payments.

CERB ran out in the fall but they extended it by a month. After that, they shifted me over to Employment Insurance aka EI and I continued getting the same payments.

I finally found work in mid January, but it is only part time. You can stop EI any time you choose OR when you get full time work. Now I submit my biweekly hours and earned wages to EI and they send me supplementary payments which currently average around $620. 

Eventually, we hope for things to pick up at work so I can be made full time and quit EI, but it’s slow this time of year even without a pandemic so I’m very grateful for Service Canada and how well they’ve been taking care of me.",2021-03-22 23:06:58

grtzf3s,"If you're just getting into reading then... so, mostly it'll depend on your interests.  *Personally,* I have a real taste for sci-fi and fantasy, so take my suggestions with that warning in mind.  Heck, I'll lead in with some non-fiction to soften things.

*Guns, Germs, and Steel* is a book on history that addresses topics like, ""why did the Europeans invade the Americas and not the other way around?""  I understand that are some criticisms as regards a few particulars of the book, but the broad strokes remain viable.

*Stiff* is a book about the dead.  Specifically, cadavers.  Like... if you donate your body to science, what does that *mean?*  What does science *do* with your body?  The author (Mary Roach) is relatable, charming, and delivers the material well.  If you enjoy *Stiff* then I also highly recommend *Bonk,* which is done in similar style about sex.

*Consider the Fork* is a history of cookware - like, forks vs chopsticks, when certain pots were invented in what locations and why.  Fun trivia - the first actual refrigeration units (other than iceboxes) were these big gnarly steam-powered bastards used to cool warehouses... full of ice.  For iceboxes.

*The Physics of Superheroes* addresses how various superheroes would affect the world around them (in ways not addressed in the comics) and even provides the math at an algebra level, so pretty accessible.  Topics like... okay, if Superman can leap tall buildings in a single bound, what does that mean?  How much energy does Superman apply to the pavement to achieve enough lift to leap a tall building, and what does that do to the pavement?  I really enjoyed it.

Sort of straddling the line between fiction and non-fiction:

Neil Gaiman's book of Norse Myths is a fantastic translation of many Norse myths, though it often sacrifices literal translation for better storytelling.  Personally, I feel that favoring storytelling over literalism is probably a better match for the spirit of mythology than the purely academic route, but I also see how others could disagree.

Last one: *Dear Leader: My Escape from North Korea* is precisely what it sounds like.  It's an autobiography from a North Korean escapee, and a fascinating snapshot of life inside North Korea.

Okay, on to the fiction.

*The Name of the Wind* is big hotness in many fantasy circles, and is generally really highly thought-of.  It's a man telling the stories behind the stories about him.

*Neuromancer* is the grandpappy of cyberpunk as we know it.  It's vivid and violent, and while it does show age in a few places it mostly holds up.

*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* is a fun comedy that you may have seen the movie for.  It's an absurd blast that explores a lot more than the movie had meaningful time for.

And... Terry Pratchett is categorically pretty solid.  His Discworld series earned him a knighthood, and for good reason.  I'm especially fond of *Reaper Man,* *The Last Continent,* *Hogfather,* *Night Watch,* and *Going Postal.*

edit: Oh, forgot one!  *The Folding Knife* is a sort of low-fantasy drama set in merchant republic that's a clear knockoff of Venice, and just loaded with betrayals and murders and such.  This author - KJ Parker - deals pretty exclusively in tragedy, but this is one of his few standalone novels, so it's a good way to test the waters and see if he's to your tastes.",2021-03-22 22:51:25

I *like* being able to make it someone else's problem when the boiler's out or the shower in the master bathroom is hosed.  I don't like being responsible for maintenance.  I like being able to move at (more or less) a whim without figuring out what the heck I'm gonna do with the house.",2021-03-22 22:39:09
grtxnv0,Buying.  Renting exposes you to landlords who are universally scumbags.  Also the US has very little in the way of tenant protections.  Almost all of the laws are pro-landlord.  It also costs more in the long run.,2021-03-22 22:38:29
grtybxz,"Depends on the market/location. In many states, the average person is going to be better off renting a home. Sure, in buying, the cost works out to be much less month-to-month in the long run. However, many first-time homeowners dive in and are shocked by the never-ending list of repairs. It's overwhelming. There is no landlord to step in and be held legally responsible. 

Some states have pretty decent tenant rights. In the end, it's a matter of doing your homework. Know your rights as a tenant. Know the complexities of mortgages and contracts and home repairs.",2021-03-22 22:43:26
grtykwu,"Always buying, you are building equity through ownership of the property. When you rent that money is gone. I could sell my house I have lived in for 5 years tomorrow and walk away with a physical asset, cash. If I had rented a property that money would be gone.

The only thing which could offset ownership is if you allow yourself to get wrapped into a property with too many sunk costs. What I mean is dont buy a house at market value with too main needed repairs as you will not get most. If any, of that money back. BUT the money is only lost if you sell it below your committed costs. Traditionally home prices rise and sitting on property provides you with additional assets come retirement for which you could liquidate if needed.",2021-03-22 22:45:15
grtzios,Buy to build equity.  I bought my house for 200000 in 2003 and everything selling in my neighborhood is 300000 to 350000 currently.  Owning a good well maintained house is a solid investment.,2021-03-22 22:52:08
gru1r6y,"In general, buying a house will be better long term. But it depends on a lot. Do you plan on moving a lot? Are you prepared to take care and maintain the house? Are you prepared for a landlord to kick you out after a lease? How much say do you want in your house (interior stuff, from carpets to cabinets). 

For me, I'd love to buy a house. I'm lucky to have an amazing landlord currently, but I'd like to be able to change things how I'd like them. And fix things that my landlord considers non-essential (ie, like get screens on all my windows, as well as get windows that open/close properly). 

And I don't want to move around. I wanna stay put. So i'll get enough repayments on a mortgage before ever moving to make it worth it. Eventually, i'll pay off the house and i'll not have to pay that monthly mortgage payment anymore, just save a bit each month towards repairs and taxes - which you are already paying for in a rent payment anyway.",2021-03-22 23:08:21
grty0eg,Owning a house is pretty much only a benefit when you own two or more and can rent out the ones you're not living in.,2021-03-22 22:41:05
grtyd7c,"Depends on the situation. You should do the math, and consider many other factors like flexibility/mobility.

Depending on where you live, Renting can be cheaper or more expensive than owning. So that's the first thing to consider, what saves you money in the long run. Rent is usually cheaper than owning because owning requires you also paying property taxes, insurance, etc. It's not just the mortgage. Also, many mortgages will also require a certain $ down payment, and if you don't have that saved, well you can't get a good mortgage anyway, so you are forced to rent.

Also, buying means you own the home and will have to pay for all repairs for yourself. As opposed to if you have plumbing issues in a rental, the landlord pays those repairs. It's their property, they have to make sure it functions and pay for that. 

Other than money, the biggest factor of rent/buy is flexibility. When you buy Real Estate, you are locking into that area, usually for a 30 year mortgage. You \*can\* resell and move of course, and you probably will a couple times in life, but selling a home and buying a new home, that's a lot of work. 

So if you are in a situation were mobility is important, like if you are young and not settling down yet, or in a job that may get transfers to other areas... renting becomes a lot more favorable.",2021-03-22 22:43:41

instead of

    if (x == 1) { ...

which is the kind of thing you normally encounter in school, tutorials, etc.

They mean the same thing: the '==' part means compare, but a single-equals '=' means assign. In C, both assign & compare produce a value that can be tested with 'if', and a common error is to assign a value with '=' when you mean to compare a value with '==', so putting the constant 1 on the left side prevents an accidental assignment, and is immediately caught by the compiler. It's a really good habit to get into.

I have a degree in electrical engineering, but where I work, there are firmware engineers (FPGA design), digital engineers, RF/analog engineers (radio & antenna designers), mechanical packaging engineers, thermal engineers(mechanical engineers that analyze heat dissipation in circuit boards and enclosures), etc. 
if you’re not sure what you want to do, then start with figuring out what you DON’T want to do. 
So take electives that you’re curious about and apply for internships. 
Also, networking and developing your people skills is super helpful as an engineer. A lot of engineers are brilliant but have a hard time communicating their ideas with others. Learn how to communicate ideas clearly, this helps a lot even in interviews.",2021-03-22 22:43:44

People who visited thought it was entertaining, but having the cops show up all the time and hearing people swearing their heads off everyday just outside your door got old fast. They left their dog chained up outside when they went away for over a week once and we had to call the cops because it had been so long. Parties every weekend and at least once a weeknight. They never put their rubbish bags out properly so there'd be escaped rubbish littering the verge and gutters and because we're the house at the front it looked like ours.

They got kicked out after a year or so and when they moved out they left a stereo blasting music inside their house so freaking loud I was surprised it took someone over twenty four hours to make a noise complaint (police ended up shutting power off to the house).

grtuc6f,"Here’s my story:


So this literally happened less than a week ago.

So I have been looking for a bike recently because my old one broke. It broke right before winter hit so we waited to get one until spring because there’s no point in buying a bike in the winter. Especially up north where I live. Anyways, my dad and I went to target to look at bikes. Going to an actual bike shop would have been a better idea, because you would rather go to a place that specializes in bikes rather than a place that doesn’t have a fuking clue about what they’re selling at all. So my dad and I went to the bike section, and we were just looking. I wanted a mountain bike so right away that took at least half of the options away. We found a decent mountain bike for only 350 and it was perfect for my size. About 20 seconds after we had found the bike that we were interested in, a couple that seems to be in their late 50’s or early 60’s comes to the bike section. They start taking really loud, and eventually start looking at the bike that we were interested in. Pretty sure they knew we wanted it. They were just being socially inappropriate. Before they came, my dad and I had asked an employee to help us get the bike down, because it was hanging up. When the employee came and got the bike down, the man of the couple budged in front of us like he was the one getting the bike. And this guy had no mental disorders at all. Just being socially inappropriate. My dad kind of budged in front of him to kind of send a signal to say “what the f are you doing”. After some final thoughts, we decided to get it. On our way to the checkout, we kept seeing the guy following us. Whenever we would look back at him, he would look away and pretend he was focused on something else. This happened until we got to the register which of course on the other side of the store. Once we bought it, we headed back to my dad’s car. He packed up the back and started driving. Once we were out of the parking lot, we saw a car following us. Whenever we turned, they turned. This happened until the last block to our house, where they split up. I shrugged it off as a coincidence. Nothing happened until that night. I was in bed watching TV. My room is in the basement, and I can hear every little noise that happens upstairs. At about 11 PM I was hearing thumps upstairs. My family was in bed so I was a bit confused. And my dog was in my room that night, so something was wrong. I armed myself with a bat that I keep under my bed for situations like this. I crept upstairs and quietly opened the door. Nothing was off other than the front door was wide open. Now I knew something was wrong. Nobody leaves their front door open at night. That was when I heard some banging in the garage. I gathered the very little courage that I had to check it out. I should’ve called the police right away. I peeked through the door that lead to the garage and I saw someone in our garage, much bigger than my dad. I was somehow able to keep my scream in, and I ran to the phone and called the police. When a car was on its way, I woke up my parents and told them. My dad got a knife and ran to the garage and turned on the lights. Pretty obvious but it was the guy from target. I locked up my bike that was buy my dad’s boat, and the guy was trying to cut the chain. The police came within minutes and arrested the guy. I can’t believe he wanted the bike that bad. I don’t know what lesson there is here, but just go shopping for bikes at a place that specializes in them. 

TLDR- went bike shopping and crazy man wanted the bike that I got. Then he broke into my house at night trying to Steal the bike, probably would have killed me too.",2021-03-22 22:14:23

It also gets increasingly good the smaller of a fraction of it you are. For example, if you are an ass, that means you are dumb, or dislikeable. If you half-ass something, it just means you did a poor job or lazily went about it, not too concerned about results. However, if you are a piece of ass, that means you are sexy.

And commonly, teachers usually use 1 or 2 fixed routines and assignments to access all students learning styles, which also doesn’t make much sense. 

So I think it’s up to the kid to realize how powerful education &/or technical skills can be in our digital age, (the infrastructure to provide the same level of tech for all students in k-12) and up to the educator to stay current and evaluate how they run a class fairly for an actually diverse student body",2021-03-22 22:30:38

Chocolate is another nice/cheap option. Get her some nice chocolate, not your standard candy bars. It shouldn't run you more than $20.

Lotion. Stores like Bath and Body Works usually have sales where you can get multiple lotions or lotions/shower gel combos for very reasonable prices and they smell absolutely amazing. Throw in some other scented/girly products like some candles, wax for warmers, outlet plugins, hand sanitizer, a loofa, whatever you want, all very cheap and usually available in the same store by the check out area, to make it more of a ""gift basket"" kind of gift. I always loooove receiving candles as gifts because I burn them literally anytime I'm home so buying me a candle means I save some money and if you didn't get me a scent I usually buy for myself I have the opportunity to discover something new I'll probably like.

Around the holidays, many stores have all kinds of ""gift basket"" type of gifts when it comes to things like hair/makeup/fragrance products. I'd definitely find out what brands your mom generally uses before going for this. Some women will absolutely love and appreciate an eyeshadow palette or a set of lip glosses or something, even if they're on the cheaper side/from a supermarket or a drugstore, others won't, and exclusively use specific brands/higher end products.

I was working multiple jobs at times, trying to make ends meet, putting myself through school, taking years to get my bachelor's degree because I wasn't able to be a full time student while juggling my job(s) and everything else in my life. They were living with their parents, or having a good portion of their life, even after they moved out, financed by their parents, driving much nicer cars than I could afford, focusing on their education, buying new shiny phones and lovely outfits and shoes left and right, never worrying about being able to pay rent in full/on time or worrying about buying both groceries and gas before their next paycheck. This made me realize that I had grown up very quickly. I had more in common with my coworkers in their late twenties/early thirties than I did my social circle in my teens/early twenties.

I also get the occasional rude awakening that I'm getting older. I'm in my early thirties currently but I'm getting called ""ma'am"" constantly, and not just at work/by clients/in other professional environments.

I think culturally we’re still in the process of breaking a lot outdated ideas and beliefs on both what healthy masculinity and femininity look like. Being told “be a man.” and believing that showing emotion and vulnerability is weakness, when in reality it is also strength. 

This is my own philosophy as I plan on having a family one day, I wanna be someone my kids could look up to and depend on. I would want to raise them both intellectually, and emotionally intelligent. I want them to know they don’t have to think and act a certain way because that’s what our culture appears to deem valuable and desirable. As a kid my parents were always working to support me and my siblings, so I kinda had to figure things out myself. I see now how being 24 I can work towards being someone who can provide a better life than what I had. 

Not to say I hold anything against my parents, they were young and did the best they could. I think any parent who loves their kid doesn’t want them to struggle the way they did either.

I don’t believe it has anything to do with your biology but rather how you feel deep down, do you feel like songs about men relate to you and when you see or hear stories about men doing stuff do you connect with them or wish to be them? 

As someone who’s a trans woman I can certainly say that my penis dosnt define who I am, being a man or woman is physiological you don’t need to be able to give birth to be a mother nor do you need to make semen to be a father you just need to claim that identity or title. Being male or female is different, that’s biological, it’s built into you, it’s not how your brain thinks, it’s how your built. An example of this is intersex individuals, they aren’t solely male or female, they’re intersex (they carry both male and female anatomy and biological traits to some degree), they can still be a man or woman tho cuz it’s their identity or they can be non binary or whatever other gender they chose fits them.

grtzbc0,"When I look back to my childhood and my years at school, people usually look back to the negative things that happened, but almost never to the positive things.  I can admit that I and school never went well together, but there are those moments that you start to look back on things over time as you get older.

I was a child who did many things with the family, such as going to amusement parks, vacations, events, concerts and festivals.  And I was a kid that nobody believed me to do so much in my spare time, so I never got to talk about it.

I can tell you a bit about the times when I went to certain quarries in Germany with my grandfather, father and nephew.  Rock walls of meters high, where we chopped here and there into the rock walls with hammer-sized pickaxes.  Mostly they were lime quarries where we found fossils of ammonites and shells, also sea urchins. And in the anthracite quarries we found fossils of ferns and tree bark.

We have also been to excavated volcanoes, transformed into sand quarries, where we lay in the sand for days looking for haüyn.  This is a blue very fragile crystal type of which lumps larger than 1 centimeter are very rare.  What we found were no larger than 5 millimeters.

grtzicx,"I could talk about this for days...

To begin, I am an alphabet person.

The alphabet community is not unified. In fact, it has many ideas that boil with conflict inside the community.

Many gay/trans people think bisexuality and pansexuality don't exist. This alienates the pansexual, bisexual community which might be the largest demographic.

Exposure therapy is proven to work. You absolutely can change your mind and how it responds to things, and yet many people in the alphabet community claim your sexuality is static and cannot change. This is contradictory to leading psychological science.

I am a pansexual for instance, and I believe my sexuality has changed as a direct result of my efforts to familiarize myself with my own sex. I was not always attracted to my own sex. But of course, this discussion triggers people so violently they are unwilling to even consider it.

The trans community is absolutely vicious to each other about various topics. The Trans community has bisected into a demographic who thinks you should be free to identify however you please (call them the true transhumanists) vs another demographic who thinks the gender roles should be strengthened specifically so they can be more easily identified (call them the traditional transexuals.)

Many traditional transexuals love gender norms because they specifically want to be of a normalized sex different from their origin sex. Blaire White is a traditional transexual for example. She **wants** to be a stereotypical 50s era housewife and the degradation of female stereotypes also degrades the stereotype she wants to be.

If you know Blaire White at all you'll know that many younger transexuals (true transhumanists) have been very hostile to her (and vise versa).

True transhumanists are slightly more universal in their beliefs, in that they generally believe gender norms should be discarded and people should be given gender/sexual equity and complete freedom in identification. The true transhumanists is a younger movement and still has a lot of ideas that need to be matured.

For example, some transhumanists think we should be free to identify as anything to include mystical beasts and abstract concepts, and people who choose an identity should not be treated any poorer in society regardless of how distant from center they are.

I personally, am closer aligned to the true transhumanists, but I am also wise enough to know that some transhumanist ideas are hundreds of years away, and this is a good thing because there is an infinite number of potential side effects for some of the things they claim should already be assimilated into society.

Biological sex is purely determined by the gametes you produce. Why? Because biological sex is something that a lot of other species beyond humans exhibit and, as a scientific concept, needs to account for and describe all of the species that reproduce sexually. And the only thing that all of these species have in common is that they have two members: one that produces large, sedentary gametes (eggs/ova) and one that produces small, mobile gametes (sperm/pollen). There are loads of different chromosomal and phenotypical arrangements that sexually reproducing organisms have. But the gamete production dichotomy is the only thing that is standard across ALL of them.

grtu3ld,"We all have some form of trauma. No childhood is perfect, and even small interactions can sometimes leave lasting lifelong trauma unless the person really works to move beyond the trauma. And then there are serious situations that will leave permanent trauma no matter how hard you try. Most people carry their trauma until they die.

If you date someone, you date a traumatized person. Even if they don't show it. We all have baggage. 

The point of being human is to survive these experiences, learn from them, grow as a human and come to some catharsis regarding that trauma that allows you to not forget the trauma, but learn to move beyond it and live a better life. This is easier said that done. 

Some people have the right personality and take the proper steps, and they grow very strong and overcome INSANE trauma. 

Other people don't have this personality, don't take those steps, and they are crippled by their trauma, even if the trauma was very slight and not super serious. These people will be debilitated by this trauma and never move passed it.

If you date someone with trauma they are struggling with, your best move is to support them and encourage them to find help to get beyond it. It's not an overnight thing. Sometimes it takes a lifetime.",2021-03-22 22:12:42

grtvtwg,"* Don't wait your turn. This isn't a video game.  If you can hit them hit them and keep hitting them until you think they can't hit you anymore.
* Fight to win.  The last thing you want is to have someone you were just throwing fists at having you at their mercy.  The victor determines what happens to the fallen.  It sounds cliche and out of date, but it's true.  You're not always going to be some school kid who has a teacher to come and bail you out.
* Don't expect anyone to fight fair.  Friends jump in, rocks are picked up, people hold you from behind, groins are kicked, eyes are gouged, sand is thrown.  Expect the unexpected as best you know how.
* Whether you're fighting for honor or your life, act like it.  If you're fighting because someone slapped your gf or w/e, then don't go pick up a rock or something because that takes away from the spirit of the argument-- and that *is what this is, a non-verbal argument*.  On the other hand if you're fighting for your well being, go for the throat.  Fight as dirty and as mercilessly as you possibly can.  It's better to have to explain a dead body than to be one.  Plus, you'd be surprised at what the human body can take.  Not to mention, you probably won't even reach the point where someone is going to lose their life, seeing as how people tend to back off the moment something is broken or dislocated.  Even so, that's not your problem.  Hopefully.
* Don't start fights if you can avoid it.  They're more trouble than they're worth.
* In the even you do need to start a fight because the trouble is worse than anything that can come out of the fight itself, hit first, hit hard. ***Hard***.  Commit to your victory from the start and try to settle things as soon as possible.
* You have no stamina.  You aren't a boxer and hopefully neither are they.  Don't expect to get off more than 30 some odd punches at full power over the course of the 2 minute fight.  You're going to be more worn out than you appreciate, adrenaline or no, thanks to the grappling and other nonsense you'll have to deal with.
* Learn the basic strategies that go into street fights so you're prepared.  People tend to take off their shirts so it isn't pulled over their heads like in a hockey fight.  Watch your legs as people will scoop them to mount you.  Things of that nature.
* Know how to make a fist and throw a punch.  Don't tuck your thumb, punch by rotating your hips, try to strike with your first two knuckles, keep your wrist straight and lined up with your arm, and aim for the chin, nose, eye, or temple.  There's more to it but that should get you started.
* If you don't know how to kick, don't.  And know that it can be considered disrespectful to do so in a fight, so people might use it as an excuse to fight dirty.
* Try not to wrestle or grapple.
* Kicking someone while their down is ""assault with battery"" or a deadly weapon or something or another.  Essentially, you'll be in more trouble than if you didn't do that when the cops come around.",2021-03-22 22:25:05

Like shot them with a pistol then went back inside for a rifle to shoot them in the head. His last words were “you should’ve kept your fucking mouth shut bitch” as he blew the girls head off. It’s a very tense time right now and people are just waiting for that spark to their fuse. Be careful, that’s all",2021-03-22 22:28:31

If its a matter of grave circumstances, like your being mugged or beat up and there's a chance you might die, my mother gave me some tips for this sort of thing.  
Now most people try to aim for someone's jaw or nose when punching someone in the face. This is troublesome since those parts are quite strong and protected by bone, if you really want to hurt someone there's this spot near the ear, right where it bridges unto the neck, that soft part? If you hit that part chances are they'll get discombobulated, get dizzy and whatever. You should be careful though because if that spot gets hit numerous times it might swell up and if it swells up it could block the blood flow and trap the blood in that area, which could lead to death.",2021-03-22 22:12:43
grty9ji,"- he who falls first loses. And probably gets the holy blue hell kicked out of him. PROTECT YOUR HEAD AND NECK.

- real life isn't a movie. You can't just magically take repeated blows to the head without significant consequences.

- related to the last point, if you win the fight, STOP. You're not going to want to stop. When the animal hormones are bubbling in your brain you're going to desire blood like a fucking wolf. You will go to prison if you listen to them...1 hit is all that stands between ""self defense"" and ""attempted manslaughter"" when you give someone a permanent brain injury or worse.

- Don't expect your opponent to fight fair, especially if you're winning. Keep your eyes peeled for metal.

- The correct time to learn to fight isn't when you're in a fight. Muscle means surprisingly little if you don't know how to use it and speed often trumps strength. A person with very little fighting practice will mop the floor with someone who has none almost every time. Get involved in your own self defense. It's YOUR responsibility. Join a dojo or a boxing gym or something. 

- Frozen peas conform to divots and peaks on your head. Use them as soon as you can after taking a few to the chops. The sooner after being hit you apply the ice, the less severe the swelling will be, up to a point, and thus the less likely you are to have nerve or eye damage. 

- Skulls are shockingly hard. Hitting the face will royally fuck up your knuckles. Pressure points are vastly superior. Again, learn an actively practice a martial art. Even a little is vastly preferable to none.

- Don't pick fights you can't finish and don't think just because someone's smaller than you or unassuming that they can't make you look like a total mong in front of your girlfriend. Not everyone who's seen shit carries external evidence of their experience. Ameture boxers are not built like Mike Tyson but they can floor you in 1 or 2 hits, literally faster than you will know what happened.

- Don't get in fights. It demeans us all...",2021-03-22 22:42:56

grtyvr7,"If you're confident in your power, the lower stomach.  Getting your opponent to double over and lose all their air is a game changer.  Hits to the face sting, and disorient, but that sting doesn't become *pain* until after the fight.  The stomach, however, hurts **right away**.  And people tend to waste an arm clutching their stomach rather than putting their dukes up.  Not to mention it's embarrassing, and the pain might cause them to back out of a fight whereas a sucker punch to the face my cause them to go *into* a fight on pure instinct. 

Face:  Oh!  He hit me!  Better hit back!  
Stomach: ***OW!*** He hit me!  I don't want that to happen again!\*  
Stomach A: Better hit back!  
Stomach B: Better gtfo outta here!

If you're not confident, go for the face.  I suggest the eye. It's soft, and no matter how muscular you are, you can't make it sturdier.  Not to mention ""blinding"" someone at the beginning of a fight is a huge leg-up.  It can also lead to a ""Stomach B"" scenario, if you will.  They also won't permanently lose sight.  I've never seen or heard of that happening without someone jamming an extended thumb or key or something into their eye, so swing for the fences.

If you're fighting for your life, the throat.  Just crush it with all your might.  It'll take their life but that's what you're fighting for so...

Failing those two, the temple or the jaw.  The jaw has a special property in which you can paralyze someone for 2 seconds for a follow up attack if you hit it just the right way, but don't count on that.  It is much easier to dodge a hit to your jaw than the temple though, so I recommend going for that.  It's solid, an easy target, and will do damage.  Not the hospital kind, unless you're Mike Tyson, in which case why are you here listening to me, right?  So just throw a right hook to the side of their head.",2021-03-22 22:47:28

They used this victimhood to justify killing the accused.  Although dominating politics and society since the founding of the U.S., they continue to play the victim to use their political power to oppress others.  Gays being allowed to marry was portrayed as victimizing christian bakery owners.

White victimhood has been a currency since reconstruction.  Southern whites declared they were the victims and used it to justify re-oppressing blacks.  When white racists switched from the Democratic party to the Republican party after the civil rights act they brought their victimhood to the Republican party and made it a key feature of the party.

The term politically correct is the cornerstone of conservative victimhood.  Although politics is in reality dominated by straight, white, male christians the term ""politically correct"" is used to pretend that gays, non-whites, females, and non-christians are actually controlling politics.

I did this.  I've been without a smartphone for almost 7 years.  For 2 of those years I was without a phone period.  I still, however, had a laptop.  I would take what is trending and popular online and go engage people in the street with the terminology ... maybe MAYBE 10% of the people I spoke knew what I was talking about, or gave a shit.

Besides, just doing your own job to a high level of excellence, ,making your boss's job easier is the best way to get noticed by them as well as learning what is important to a manager in your organization. If your boss is a good manager, they will have as one of their goals the desire to train their own replacement (so they can also  move up in the current organization or prepare properly for a different organization).",2021-03-22 22:18:24

Bosses hand out promotions, they don't just happen because you've been there long enough. 

Along with that, back up all of this with hard work. Don't break your back and avoid family, but do well at your job and act like you want to be there. Wedge yourself into activities that will expose you to new things. Volunteer to work on something that will show off your skills. You can't sit and wait for a promotion. Additionally, the majority of bosses will cite experience levels as to why you will or won't get a promotion. Push for opportunities to get that experience and then document it. Often times, management will look for many ways to not give a promotion or pay raise. If they keep finding excuses not to promote you and it's not to do with your work ethic or experience, then it's time to search for something else.",2021-03-22 22:20:57

interview prep

job shadowing / coffee convesations

CV structure and presentation (not just a resume)

even if you dont know what you want as next steps, but are looking for a promotion/move, the onus is still on you to start the conversation with your boss so they can help look for opportunties they feel you'd be a fit for.

gru1rde,"Prisoners beat up other prisoners because they are not nice people. That's what got them placed in prison in the first place. 

In all seriousness though, prison violence is a problem throughout the U.S. corrections system, and worldwide as well, for three reasons. 

The first issue, is that there are a lot of violent people in one place. If in a normal city in the U.S. there are 10 crimes committed per 100,000 people then it follows that encountering crime in the community would be relatively rare. When you put those 10 people in a room together and tell them they can't leave, the chances of encountering violence skyrockets. 

The second issue is more specific to the U.S., and that is that the corrections system is so punitive that it in essence breaks people. In the U.S. more people are incarcerated per capita than anywhere in the world. Add to that problem that U.S. prisons lack readily available programming and education for inmates and its a powder keg waiting for a proverbial spark. 

The final issue that gives rise to prison violence, particularly in the U.S., is that the U.S. Department of Corrections is the largest provider of mental health services in the nation. This is the result of the deinstitutionalization movement of the 1970s, where states shuttered all of their mental health facilities. Today's prisoners have very little access to mental healthcare, and what is provided is a bare minimum of treatment. 

tl;dr Prisons are full of violent and mentally ill people who lash out at being treated badly",2021-03-22 23:08:23

However, ""pride"" is also one of the 7 deadly sins for a reason. Being TOO proud can lead to negative outcomes. Having a baseline pride and respect for yourself is good. That's just self-esteem. Having too much pride will mean you start to turn that pride on other people, you start looking down at others, start becoming arrogant, start becoming hateful of others. That's not good.

What is there to be proud of for being white? Not saying it's shameful, but it's also not a point of pride. If you're proud of your heritage, that's one thing - there's nothing wrong with being proud of Irish, German, Swedish, etc heritage. I'm half Irish and shamelessly go hard every St. Patty's day. I have an Irish tin whistle and regularly listen to Celtic music. But white culture isn't really a thing and is nothing in and of itself to be proud of. 

So then what about black pride? Most of them don't know their roots, and those who learn as much as they can about it find some pretty horrific stuff. I'm not saying that you as a white dude have to feel personally remorseful for it, but you should acknowledge they have every right to be proud of what they were left, especially when that group has been systemically oppressed for as long as they've been here. 

Again, it's not shameful to be white, I'm not ashamed that I'm white. However, the only time I see anyone ask this question is when they're being reactionary about black pride, and anyone who has an issue with black pride is absolutely ignorant about our history.",2021-03-22 22:06:02

Now, maybe things you've heard from other people, or things you've seen on the internet, have convinced you that ""whites are being shamed and persecuted"". That's not true. A lot of it is just sensationalism and/or a minority of people being assholes. I'm a working class white guy and I'm not being shamed for being white, and I work with a variety of people. The key is, if you want respect, you got to give respect. I respect the people around me as long as they aren't treating me like shit. And in turn, most respect me back. I  don't let the color of their skin or my skin get in the way of that. 

So when is it acceptable to be a working white male? Anytime you want, as long as you treat others with respect. But if you start acting like you are better than them, and start being disrespectful to others,  don't be surprised if they start pushing back.",2021-03-22 23:15:38

You can't pay a wage employee for seven hours when they've worked for eight. That's illegal.",2021-03-22 23:38:16

grtrzp5,"Stay in touch with mutual friends and family, but allow for everyone's unique method of grieving. Sometimes a person needs company but not conversation, so be prepared to just sit in silence if the vibe lends to it. If you're doing the grieving, don't hesitate to reach out and let the people in your circle know you need help.

Be careful not to try and numb the pain too much. Obviously if you're a drinker or whatever, do your thing. But keep in mind that substances have a tendency to delay the emotional processes that you need to move forward. 

Some people need to be surrounded by imagery or trinkets to remind them who they lost, others need to avoid those things for the same reason. If you know you appreciate seeing their picture, for example, but break down uncontrollably, you may want to avoid emotional triggers at work. 

Whatever your beliefs are, we all agree that we only get the one shot and death comes for us all. Keep that person's memory alive in you, but also use it as a reminder to express your feelings more and inform the ones you love how you think about them. Let it motivate you to spend more time doing what you love, with the people you love most.

Smh. You're totally gatekeeping, but you're the same as the kind of person you're complaining about. You haven't read every single marvel comic. You probably haven't even read all the golden age series.

grtriod,"Idk about ""feeling empty"" lol, that's a bit dramatic.

However, I was really let down by Cyberpunk. Even bugs aside (and that's saying a lot already, I had to fight through hundreds of crashes to beat the game lol) the game was just.... okay. It was kind of sub-par.

There's a youtuber showing direct comparisons of AI and NPCs with GTA5 and Cyberpunk and it makes you realize how bad Cyberpunk actually is. I know it's sort of unfair to compare any game to one of the GOATs like GTA, but GTA5 is 7 years old now. And CDPR had insane amounts of time and funding for Cyberpunk.

Cyberpunk just has so many flaws and let downs. The bugs are rough, the physics aren't that good. The AI/NPCs are pretty trash and that obviously makes the world feel way more robotic and silly. 

Even worse, the main story is rather short, and the side content is almost completely empty feeling. I did every mission in the game basically, and almost all of the side content is just ""go here, kill them, grab the shard, done."" with no real heart to it.

So yeah, I expected Cyberpunk to be at least a top tier AAA title, a GotY candidate. It wasn't this. Instead of an A or A+ game, it's like a B or B-. Still well worth playing, still fun for what it is, but it's not a GotY, and certainly wont be remembered as one of the games of this era.

The phone didn't have any reception so I called support and they said return that phone and will try another one. Went to the store to pick up the other phone. Said to the guy ""I have to pick up another phone and I have to pay my bill. Support told me I could just swap the phone no charge"". The guy goes ""okay but you should get a cover for the phone that I'm giving you"". I said all I have is the money for my bill but if you can put the cover on my account and I can make payments on it I'll do that. He says okay. I go okay let me pay my bill he says that'll be $29. I said wow I thought it was going to be higher but that's cool. I leave the store and on my way home I look at the phone and the hole on the cover doesn't line up with the fingerprint sensor, wrong cover. I get home and I look at my account and it says I still owe my bill? I call up support and they say I'm looking at your account you haven't paid your bill but you did just buy a phone cover for $29 cash. And there's been additional services added to your account so your monthly bill is now $125. I blew up told them I didn't order that was on the phone with him for an hour and finally they lowered my bill again to $59 took off the additional charges. I later found out that the new phone also wasn't getting service in my area. So I called support they were very helpful tried a bunch of things and the phone seemed to work better for a while. Then I went and looked at my account and they had added services again and it was up to $180.

For example, in American professional basketball last night, the Phoenix Suns beat the Los Angeles Lakers by the exact score of 111-94. The Chicago Bulls beat the Detroit Pistons by the exact score of 100-86.

What were the odds that two games, happening on the same night in the same country, would have a final score of exactly 111-94 and exactly 100-86? Well, that probability is quite rare. When was the last time the NBA had two games ending at 111-94 and 100-86 on the same night? When will be the next time this happens? It's all quite irrelevant.

The fact of the matter is that **exactly** six out of eight victims were Asian is not the interesting part.

If six out of eight victims were Black, people would still be talking about it. If six out of eight victims were Muslim, people would still be talking about it. What if the victims were all immigrants from the country of Kiribati? What if the victims were firefighters? What if the victims were men named Jason? What if the victims all had even-numbered birthdays? What if the victims all had social security numbers that were prime numbers? (For you Brits out there, social security numbers are what you would refer to as national insurance numbers.)

Trazodone was supposed to help, it did not -- but I slept through everything, so there is that. :-(

If a white person wants to draw on their own experience of being discriminated against to understand why minorities feel the way they do, how can that be bad. Stymieing conversation because ""white people can't experience discrimination"" will only serve to further slow progress in our society. No one should experience discrimination because of their skin color or other personal characteristic. The sooner we latch onto that idea the better off our society can become.

This is a non-sensical question. You can't abolish the two party system because people will still align themselves with people that share similar beliefs.

It happens organically, not by intentional choice.

> change the way the voting/electoral college/declaration of a winner works?

There's flaws with the current system, but it's far better than just switching to a straight popular vote.

The founding fathers were aware that the system was unfair when they set up the system. In fact, they quite intentionally made it unfair so that you don't have tyranny of the majority. By disproportionately giving additional weight to the minority opinion (which at the time, were small states), you make sure that the minority opinion is still heard.

I'm comfortable doing things alone, but a lot of things are simply not fun without friends so you miss out on a lot. There are definitely times when you may need friends, like when you're having romantic problems. 

You miss out on social events but also you miss out on finding new hobbies, opportunities for new jobs, and potentially finding the love of your life. 

People love to say you shouldn't need validation but *everyone* gets validation from their friends on some level, lacking that means not only potential risk to your self worth but also social interactions are like trying to find your way in the dark. It's not just that you lose social skills, your anchor in what is normal in day to day social interaction is sort of lost. 

Its hard to explain but a lack of social connection can lead to a whole new kind of loneliness that's not easily fixed. I think people really underestimate how much having friends can help them, and thus how hard it is to exist without friendship.",2021-03-22 21:39:44

grtu81i,"A form of child abuse, a means of political control and cultural adhesion, as well as an emotional/spiritual/existential salve. 

I tend to think of it like a cultural fossil fuel: a crucial resource in the advancement of civilization that is either near or past the end of it's usefulness, and doing more harm than good as it's utility is replaced. I think religion should have died soon after the enlightenment, but it has some inherent properties that make it hard to extinguish.

We are filled with these mythologies, rituals, and dogmas when we are too young to question them. If/when doubts are raised, we are repudiated and threatened with hellfire. This amounts to gaslighting on a global scale. And like all abuse, it gets perpetuated through the generations.

Secondly, it's a powerful tool for political control. Easy to rally behind a religion, and easier still to demonize another group based on religion.""God wills it"" is not just great for ending policy debates with a self righteous wave of the hand, it's also the leading justification for nearly every genocide in history.

Third, science and technology are disruptive, they replace entire industries, they upend entire economies. The best tool against that kind of disruption is the firm anti-intellectualism that religion provides. Behind every religious zealot is an economic crisis.

Lastly, and this is my big concession, there is a ""God shaped hole"" in all of us. Maybe it's just low oxytocin, maybe it's a side effect of a pattern seeking brain, or plain old existential dread, but we all seem to be searching for solutions that religion is pretty good at providing. It's sort of like chemo-therapy in that way. There are psychological and emotional diseases that we don't know how to define yet, much less treat them. So we call these spiritual problems, and treat them with spiritual salves. For many, it's better than nothing.

Ultimately, if God is real he made me with too much doubt to believe in him. If he wants to punish me for that I can't stop him. And if I do meet him, he's got a lot to answer for, starting with leukemia.

grtoxo5,"Neither, I believe there were a lot of teachings from Christ that are very good and great ways to live. However, the bastardization and use of Christianity for control and oppression is where I have a problem.",2021-03-22 21:35:09
grtpw02,"Neither.  I think some people are naturally hardwired to need some sort of 'belief in something greater' while others are not.  From an evolutionary standpoint, there's probably even a good reason for it, since it seems to be predominant.  You couple that with man's desire to understand 'why?"" and religion is the first thing that is likely to happen.  So various religions will appear because people will always want the thing that resonates most with them and will seek out the one that matches them.  For some, it's Christianity.

Do I think that the stories in it are impossible or improbable fictions?  Of course, otherwise I'd probably not be an atheist.  But I can understand if someone has that unending need to feel connected to something greater, how a belief in something even impossible could fill that  hole and provide comfort.  I also know people who are Christians who have indeed received comfort and an easing of their mind during hard times because of their beliefs.  I can't think something like that is dumb or morally wrong.

As far as the morally wrong part of your question, do some people act wrong in the name of Christianity (or any other religion)?  Of course.  That's human nature as well.  But Christianity itself is pretty good, at least at its core:  Don't lie, don't steal, don't kill, treat everyone well... I don't think anyone can argue with any of that.  Of course people can pick and choose parts that are reprehensible to modern sensibilities, just as others pick and choose parts that they use to keep down other people, but that's as much on those people as it is the religion as a whole.",2021-03-22 21:42:12

Also, let’s be honest, the faith would not exist today without a lot of murder and theft.

The aspects unique to Christianity are so abhorrent that Christians try to downplay them, abs many do not even know they are in the scripture they have never bothered to read. For example, Christ says you must love him more than your family. He must be more important to you than your children. He says that the first and most important commandment is to worship Yahweh, yet counties Christians omit that, and decide they know better, insisting that he says loving people is most important. In contrast, Christ tells his disciples not to even go among Gentiles at all. He says that anyone who doesn’t convert and follow him will be killed when he returns. The whole point of Christ’s ministry is focused on that return, rewarding his faithful, and creating his perfect kingdom, which he says includes killing everyone who does not worship as he demands.

gru2pzo,"*The Decameron* by Giovanni Boccaccio. It's my favorite book and I reread it annually.

*The Metamorphoses* by Ovid

*The Twelve Caesars* by Suetonius (reread it last year)

*The Good Soldier Švejk* by Jaroslav Hašek

*Persuasion* by Jane Austen (reread it last year)

My favorite Shakespeare plays and the sonnets (in fact, I've read the complete works three times and I'm currently embarked on a fourth reading). These include *Hamlet*, *King Lear*, *Macbeth*, *Romeo and Juliet*, and *Titus Andronicus* among the tragedies, *Twelfth Night*, *As You Like It*, *Love's Labour's Lost*, and *Much Ado About Nothing* among the comedies, *Henry V*, *Richard II*, and *Richard III* among the histories, *Measure for Measure* as a tragicomedy or ""problem play"", and *The Winter's Tale* and *The Tempest* are my two favorite late romances. Last year, I reread *King Lear*, *Hamlet*, and *The Winter's Tale* and listened to the Arkangel Shakespeare recording of *As You Like It.*

Other than that, I also enjoy rereading several works by Shakespeare's contemporaries, including *The Duchess of Malfi* by John Webster, *The Revenger's Tragedy* by Thomas Middleton, *Volpone* by Ben Jonson, etc. I reread all three of these last year in *The Duchess of Malfi: Seven Masterpieces of Jacobean Drama* edited by Frank Kermode, which itself was a reread, but I also have other copies of all three.

I can and have reread the Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle multiple times, and I've also reread the Dr. Thorndyke Stories by ACD's contemporary R. Austin Freeman — chiefly the short stories, which I have in a single omnibus book.

*Miss Marple: The Complete Short Stories* by Agatha Christie, and just two days ago I reread *And Then There Were None*, but that was my first reread since I was ten.

I can read *anything* by Herman Melville multiple times. Most recently, it was a reread of *Bartleby the Scrivener/Benito Cereno/Billy Budd*, all three stories in one volume. I've also recently bought a copy of *Typee*, so I'll be rereading that one soon as well.

*Cyrano de Bergerac* by Edmond Rostand

*Les Liasons Dangereuses* by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos

*Don Quixote* by Miguel de Cervantes (my most recent reread was last year in the classic translation by Tobias Smollett, which I think I prefer to the modern versions I've read by Walter Starkie and Edith Grossman).

*My Life and Hard Times* by James Thurber

The Jeeves and Wooster stories and novels (except for *Ring for Jeeves*), the Mr Mulliner stories, the golf stories, and the Drones Club stories by P. G. Wodehouse. Right now I'm working my way through the Blandings Castle series, and it's just as good as the others and I'm sure I'll enjoy rereading it in the time to come as well.

She started to watch me take the test and noticed I was twirling my pencil, watching my friends, and drawing in the margins for like 50% of the test time. She then did various tests and found that isolating me and reminding me to focus resulted in me getting much higher scores.

A big point here is that these symptoms were debilitating. I almost dropped out of college, using most of my allotted class withdraws in a single year. I struggled to keep friends because I couldn’t really hold a conversation long enough to meet some.

At that point we both knew something was up. Essentially what would happen is I would read a few sentences, get distracted, then loose my place, then have to re read to remember what happened then rinse and repeat until the page was done. And it came in waves. So sometimes I could be very focused and read fine (so not dyslexia), but more often than not this is what would and also still happens (24 now).

grtr4wk,"Asking because I've been noticing symptoms of ADHD within myself.

I hate small talk, but I absolutely love deeper conversations that interest me. But, if the topic deviates from my interest, I tend to zone out. Which is probably why I have few friends but the relationships are really intimate.

I bounce around hobbies a lot. I dive into an activity, and if I'm interested, I'm practically hooked. It becomes my thing (feels like an obsession) for a month or two, but then I overdo it and get burnt out, have an existential crisis, and decide to quit. Sometimes I get back to a hobby after a long period of time passes, but the cycle only repeats.

I love watching movies, but only if they're REALLY good. Once I notice something I don't like about a film my focus slowly fades. The thought of rewatching my favorite films is pleasant enough that I decide to act upon it, but I can't seem to finish the movie thinking that I already know what happens next. Man, I wish I watched Interstellar more than once before the rental expired.

I lose shit a fuck ton.

Over the past year, I've been more aware of my emotions and how they affect my mindset. However, when I get stressed and emotional I tend to get carried away and do something dumb, only to immediately regret my mistake nearly instantly. I feel impulsive in general.

Now before I walked away I did approach these family members about their behavior and I was told every time I was ""being dramatic"" or ""over reacting,""  This month was the final straw when my brother forgot about my birthday and my father bought be clothing that was 3 sizes too small.  While I want to stick to my guns in the hopes that my family will come back to me, I know that deep down they all view their behavior as my fault.
